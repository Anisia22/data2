When I first downloaded this app I thought it was fake until I tried it I would never know what was going on when I had a pain in my chest but then I saw this and I was like oh what does this app do and I read some of the reviews and I thought for a moment and I just looked at it and decided that I would try it out and it works really well so I would suggest that other people that has a problem like random pains to see what’s going on with your heart and then tell it to your doctor to get it checked out, love this app.

1st time user of this app and I’m amazed by the brilliance design in this health monitoring app. As a patient that went thru a major heart surgery, it’s like seeing most of all the devices used on my operation are stacked and loaded up in this one app. ‘ now I’ll be a daily user.

While you are performing the test. It is natural that you will be conscious, concerned and exited a bit. That is bound to cause a sort of deviation from normal!! I don’t know if this factorized while making the conclusions on one’s heart condition😐
06 September, 2023 at 7:28 AM
If you are experiencing something similar to 'white-coat anxiety' that leads you to feel more stressed when you are taking a measurement, the easiest way is to make the experience a regular one so that your body can adjust. HRV measurements are best taken in the morning before any strenuous activity while you are still feeling relaxed.

This app is amazing especially for people with epilepsy like me because your heart rate changes during a seizure and before one happens it’s a warning sign one coming and another good thing about the app is heart rate can also slow down or even temporarily stop so the app can keep track of that and keep u updated u can look back on your graph and show your doctor

At first I was like there is no way this is really real but I tried it the first time I tried it I just got off work and I was really tired and stressed and the app said energy low and stress very high and I took another try today and today I had no work or school and I just relaxed and the app said energy high and stress low. I highly recommended this app!!

I love this app! It’s been helping me know myself lately, and helps me worry less, but I don’t think the tension a energy and stress level thing is accurate.
23 August, 2023 at 5:33 AM
Thanks for the review. Stress, tension and energy are all calculated based on various parameters of heart rate variability, and they reflect the physiological markers of your heart and nervous system. If you perform the measurement according to the instructions and get results that you don't think are correct, please send us a report from the app so that we could look into it!

I really like to monitor my heart rhythm. I have checked my heart beat at different times in one day. I was just so curious about what's on the app. Before going to see a cardiologist I am reading on this app, I am on five day challenge, I added my lab result I got on the app. I am not on the three days trial but I want to see more things the app will enable me to do. Thank you guys.

Would be 5 stars if I had the feature to export my data to the phone so I can track all other vitals in my health app, please add these feature and I even pay for it. Other than that very good app, would recommend.

This app gave me the information I needed right away, very good. I don’t agree with the subscription fee, $6.99 a week. I do understand that is pays to stay healthy but I do think majority of people would prefer a monthly subscription instead. Just a thought.

I have just started using this app and find it to be very useful. There is a ‘but’ hence not 5* at the moment. Some of the information is too low contrast I.e. very feint grey. Some of it is so minute and can’t be read without a magnifying glass!
12 February, 2023 at 12:30 PM
Thank you for the honest review. It would be helpful if you could let us know which information you found was hard to read, so we could try to improve the design.

Different HRV by twice the amount on Apple Watch
Fordham flashed
I cannot understand that my Apple Watch HRV score is almost half of every score on this app. I updated both products and they both measure ms. Every measure is like 35 in apple health and Fitbit and 68 here Why the difference?
05 February, 2023 at 7:50 AM
That's a really good question! Truthfully, there is no set standard as to what counts as "HRV" per se, so different apps have their own relative measurements of it. If you want to compare, it's best to go with looking at the raw, scientific values you see at the bottom of the measurement, such as SDNN and RMSSD. Even when scientists deal with HRV, they have to define which specific measurements of HRV they are working with. I hope that helps!

I look forward to the future when there's more. The subscription price is a bit expensive. But it seems almost everything is available in the free version.

17 January, 2023 at 7:19 AM
Dear customer, Unfortunately, blood pressure measurements can be done via a specialized device. That is because there has not been enough research proving any other methods as reliable. Same goes for temperature: it can only be measured via a specific sensor. If you do have a blood pressure monitor at home, you can record your measurements into Heartify and then export your measurement history for your next doctor visit.

Ne remplace pas un avis médical
cv1957
Les mesures faites à partir de ce logiciel ont de cela de très intéressant, c’est qu’elle vous donnent l’état réel de certaines mesures concernant votre santé cardiaque et permettent en cas de résultats anormaux de tirer la sonnette d’alarme et de consulter rapidement un professionnel de la santé. Donc ne remplace en aucun cas une expertise médicale, mais est un excellent donneur d’alerte en cas de problème.

I’ve tried many other heart rate monitors and even downloaded some for blood pressure but ended up deleting afte 2 minutes due to low accuracy, complicated interface and extremely high cost for no gaddamn reason. Heartify is by far the best I’ve tried and I’d rather pay for a subscription on this app because it’s too good, better than others and totally free

So far it’s been helping me realize how bad of health I am in and how fatigue and stress my body is , so doing the challenges that are actually very easy because to me if it’s too hard, I’m not gonna do it and just seeing some improvement in my heart health and my energy level has been helping me a lot, so I think it’s really worth having this because at certain age we have to switch over from being able to do a lot of things we used to be able to do and now getting to an age where I really need to take care of myself and keep my stress level down, so I highly recommend this I really like it a lot

Here’s where the story starts. So I was playing those 1 star games to see what their like. Obviously, there is millions of ads and I’m not surprised. I get the heartify ad and I think it’s cool. So I downloaded it and I tried, then the screen in only made for phones and that’s horrible. If you add an extension for an iPad that would be nice, and more people would likely go on your app.

Şaşırtıcı Derecede Başarılı
ShoryuReppa
Açıkçası bu uygulamayı ihtiyacımdan değil, doğru ölçüyor mu diye merakımdan indirdim. Fenix 7 saatim ile karşılaştırma yaptım. Nabız ve HRV değerleri birbirine çok yakın çıktı. Sadece stres ölçüm algoritmasının elden geçmesi gerek çünkü Garmin çok düşük stres (12) gösterirken bu uygulama yüksek stres uyarısı verdi.

Hello i tried this and thout is worked but i tried it on my pillow and it showd a heartrate Thank you for lying
30 November, 2022 at 5:10 PM
Hi! It's great that you take an inquisitive approach but it's a bit more complicated than that. Heartify measures your heart rate by tracking light changes in your finger as blood moves through your capillaries. When you hold the camera to the pillow, there are still small light changes that can be detected. However, that does not speak anything against measurement quality, because Heartify is heavily optimized for use with your index finger (not for pillows!). It's like taking your dog to see a pediatrician. Sure, the doctor knows where all the organs are located, but they're used to treating kids, not puppies!

Me sorprendió muchísimo:
Fox Yuman
Cuando escuché sobre la aplicación no pensaba que fuera posible medir el pulso con solamente la cámara de mi teléfono.. pero me sorprendió mucho cuando pudo medirlo con mucha precisión y me encanta el hecho de que no solo mide el pulso sino que mide otras cosas como el estrés, la presión etcétera y me sirve mucho ya que puedo saber con más exactitud mi condición física. por ende le doy 5 estrellas.

This is a false commercial swindle
dvlaskin
This is a humiliation for users. We want truthful information. And we're not exactly fools, as the developers think. There may be harm from conclusions. The application does not have the right to give a conclusion about variability, because it works with the pulse from the camera. Measurement within 2 minutes cannot register many parameters, for example VLF. It's not literate. The application does not use the age norm. For example, the pNN50% indicator in 50 years may be 0. This greatly distorts the result. I am ashamed of the people who decided to make money on the health of people. And I can read articles for free
14 November, 2022 at 10:13 AM
Dear Customer, Heartify measurements are based in scientific evidence. Ultra-short-term HRV measurements provide enough data to perform spectral analysis and single out LF, HF, and VLF parameters. As for the age norm, users are asked to enter their age and gender in order to adjust the measurement to available norms. Surely, there are more accurate ways for monitoring HRV, but most require wearing dedicated devices or measurement in a professional setting. PPG measurements allow people to monitor their health without the extra hassle and the need to delve into the details of scientific research just to check their HRV parameters.

Thank you for your honest review! Unfortunately, there is still not enough scientific evidence to support measuring blood pressure with a phone's camera and for now, your best bet is buying an arm-cuff monitor. What Heartify can help you with is neatly storing your BP data and exporting it for your doctor.

El estrés que ves en la aplicación es tu estrés fisiológico y no necesariamente tu estrés emocional. El estrés proviene de su sistema nervioso simpático que mantiene su cuerpo alerta. El estrés elevado puede indicar una mayor actividad de su sistema nervioso simpático.

A Good App but…
sloughsteve27
I’ve started to use this app on an almost daily basis. It took a bit of time to win me over but I’m slowly getting there even while using the free version only. The only major downside to it though is the subscription pricing. Simply way too expensive. If it was £5.99/month, I’d subscribe. And I’m sure many others would too. But at £5.99/wk, that is simply just taking the pee…

Cool Big Daddy #1
Most apps claims to be and do something they aren’t and do not do, not this app. Most of time it is spot on at detecting and acutely informing me of not only how I feel but why I’m feeling that way along with suggesting as to how to feel better. When I first saw the $65 price I was sticker shocked, $65 for an app. You have to be me, I thought. But I have to say, it is well worth the price. I look at it first thing in the morning when I awake and several times throughout the day when I notice I’m not feeling my best. I highly recommend this app to anyone who are interested in being aware of their body and are interested in feeling better.

Hallo, en bedankt voor je beoordeling. Het spijt ons voor het ongemak. Onze app heeft bewezen een positieve invloed te hebben op de levensstijl en het welzijn van gebruikers na enkele maanden gebruik. Het algoritme voor zelftraining heeft tijd nodig om je te leren kennen en hoe meer gegevens het heeft over je lichaamstoestand, activiteiten en gewoonten, hoe effectiever het wordt. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie misschien niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt en persoonlijke inzichten biedt. Daarom hebben we besloten om het maandelijkse plan geleidelijk van alle platforms te verwijderen, en het is al gearchiveerd in de App Store.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We're glad you like our app. As for translation, we have a lot of content and translating it to another language is a resource-demanding task. If we have enough requests to translate to any specific language, we will add it to our roadmap and might translate it in the future.

I love the app, it’s a great idea and development. Unfortunately, I can’t budget a hundred dollars right now and wanted to subscribe monthly. The monthly subscription option is not allowing me to change the pricing. Please change, so I can purchase.
04 October, 2023 at 6:04 AM
Hello, and thanks for your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience. The thing is that our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we're going to remove the monthly plan and it's no longer available on App Store.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Health shouldn’t be so expensive. I can’t afford to pay almost 100$ per year just to use an app. If it was priced at lifetime for that amount then it would make more sense to purchase. Lowered to 4 star due to annual cost
02 October, 2023 at 7:49 PM
Hello, and thanks for the feedback. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Deep insights and meaningful prompts for greater self-knowledge.
Tothintl
This app has already started to change my life by bringing more awareness to the patterns in my life, balance of energy and sources of stress. I signed up for ‘lifetime’ membership after two weeks! The charts and graphs that digest and present HRV data are super informative—one request—please correct graphic / contrast issues so they are more legible! The small dark text is hard for me to read. Would be great if these graphs could be blown up full screen. Thank you and keep up the great work!!

I did learn the importance of having good stress in your life and that some is needed to maintain a healthier heart ( something like that ). This is a great app by far!!

Hello and thanks for the review! Welltory tries to let you know when you physically need rest and recovery, but everyone is different, and it's possible that what you're seeing is simply your healthy norm. It's also okay for your results to show that you're stressed or overworked after a workout or a hard day — it happens to the best of us. What matters is that you can make a full recovery afterwards.

Have been using the free trial and looked to purchase as trial was only 2 days. Was disappointed to find that I could only choose the annual subscription. Having only been able to trial for two days, I am still undecided if I want to make such a financial commitment and would love the option of a monthly subscription to really get to know the app first.

Hi there, and thanks for your feedback! Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.

This app has really showed me how high my stress is on a constant basis and I’ve tested it out thinking it that it can’t be right but my test proved that this app is very accurate and it’s helped me to really work on my health and stress because I think when your stress so much your body just doesn’t know how to not stress. Unless you really work on it physically, and mentally. So I really think this app is worth it for your health and stress or whatever else you can get out of it, the tips they give you are great also A++++

Hello and thanks for the review, we appreciate the insight. It's important to note that Welltory's goal is to offer a clearer picture of how your body is doing from a lifestyle perspective, not a medical one. We are not a medical app and cannot diagnose any medical conditions, although we've received positive endorsements from professionals in the field. Our platform is designed to help you understand when your body needs rest and recovery, as your conscious experience may differ from your physiological state. That being said, if any part of our app causes you stress or anxiety, please know this isn't the intended effect. We're very open to your feedback and encourage you to reach out if something feels off.

Take in consideration of heart diseas
Klmnuio
Hello, dos the Welltory app take into consideration heart disease, bypass surgery, high BP, heart medications one is on when analyzing ones health journal?
22 September, 2023 at 12:25 AM
Hello! Generally, if you have cardiac dysfunction or elevated heart rate episodes and are taking a measurement during an arrhythmia episode, the accuracy may be low, and the measurements can be filtered out from the journal. Cardiac dysfunction affects your heart’s work and your heart rate variability. In this case, our algorithm can’t accurately analyze the state of your autonomic nervous system or the balance of its sympathetic and parasympathetic parts, so it can't gauge your body’s state either. Besides, our algorithm can’t yet distinguish between arrhythmia and a bad signal. So, if you sometimes have an arrhythmia or elevated heart rate episodes, it may take you several tries to take an accurate measurement. If you don't have a continuous irregular heartbeat, you can successfully use Welltory in between episodes. As for medications - you can record medication intake using tags and then track their impact on your metrics.

EliHSilva
O aplicativo me pareceu muito bom, tem muitas métricas interessantes, ele ajuda bastante a interpretar os dados colhidos pelo Apple Watch. Mas a assinatura em reais está fora da realidade, 1500 reais a assinatura vitalícia é algo impossível a se pagar por um aplicativo e quase 600 reais por 1 ano é igualmente surreal. Sugiro repensar esses preços.

Never been normal!
Zero Turn
These last few years have been epiphany to me. I had a stroke in 2007 and I’ve had TIAs And other vascular issues as recently as 23 weeks ago. In 2011 I went I went to a procedure to to Discover I had a bundle branch blockage of the first degree. That is the electrical signal in my heart measures three beats instead of four. I believe I was born with that. The latest issue is I have a clot in my left in my leg the big one I’ve been placed on Eliquis and told not to do any lifting, and I’ll be on that medication for six months. I fight with my live girlfriend. She said she was going to have a job and then she quit and I think she’s somewhat of a grifter. I am amazed at how well wellatory knows I’m under stress. The important thing is that sometimes I am on stress and I don’t even realize it but that is but that is par for the course when you grow up the way, I did in a very violent neighborhood and high stress working environments.

Desde hace dos días me siento con dolores de espalda, de cabeza y sudores. Además de dolor de garganta. Y desde hace dos días mi estado de salud en la app estaba al 40% y aveces menos. Pues siguiendo la recomendación de mi mujer me hice un test de COVID. Y di positivo. Ahora sí que creo que este tipo de app te da pistas reales sobre tu estado de salud actual. Un 10

This app made me cry!
Sam Thorpe
If you want to be seen, understood and cared about - this is the app for you. The analysis and personalised support are not only accurate, but I felt that I was not struggling on my own. Validation for stress and tiredness with help and support to feel better… detailed - and I mean DETAILED data analysis and layman’s terms presentation with relevant information and suggestions. This is the first app to properly explain HRV in context and present solutions. Better than any other coaching app, stress app, HRV app. Take care of YOU and get this app!

Hi Annely, we're sorry for this negative experience. Please delete the app, reboot your iPhone, and reinstall the app. It helps in most cases. Make sure you log in to your Welltory account using the same account credentials you used when you signed up. Kindly let us know if this helps.

Sneaky subscription
Quoosron
The app does what it says. I have no complaint there. However, it does not present itself on your subscriptions list in Settings, and cancelling your subscription is otherwise is I chore. I had to go into the support section of the app and chat with a bot to find a link to cancel my subscription. There is no link in the app otherwise to be able to do this. And that happened because I got billed without warning. I really don’t like companies with this approach.

Hello there. Thank you for the high rating! The thing is, Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research.

This app has been a lifesaver in so many ways. Through a notification, Welltory will warn me when I’m starting to disregulate, and it allows me to self treat with CBT or Welltory provided mediTation that is tailored to your reported symptoms rather than use more pharmaceuticals. I love the features that allow you to add symptoms to your day, moods physical wellness, and then it sends all your information over to Apple health and you get a cumulative health report for your day. With the information from Welltory, I’ve been able to plan my days as to how my system is functioning. When my tank is red, I’m already feeling crappy but with disregulated moods that flip on a dime lately I’m untrusting of my senses so when my tank is green, I have more confidence to push myself. Of course, the reason I need this app has landed me on disability and the affordability of this app, even at 40% off is for me it’s only downside.
