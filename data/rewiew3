Poging gewaagd en tot nu toe niet teleurgesteld. Ja, het is een tikje aan de dure kant en ik kon alleen per jaar betalen wat niet overeenkomt met de reclametekst. Doe daar iets aan. Inhoudelijk ben ik meer dan tevreden en leer veel over mijn fysieke en mentale staat. üëç

Hallo, en bedankt voor je feedback. Onze excuses voor het ongemak. Ons onderzoek wijst uit dat de meeste gebruikers binnen enkele maanden na het gebruik van onze app aanzienlijke verbeteringen in hun levensstijl en welzijn ervaren. Het algoritme voor zelftraining verbetert na verloop van tijd naarmate het gegevens verzamelt over je lichaam, activiteiten en gewoonten, dus de resultaten zijn effectiever op de lange termijn. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie mogelijk niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt.

pretty good, but one issue
emma_bw
i think its impressive how much data this app can give from your heart rate, and how it calculates it, however i downloaded this because recently my heartbeat has been more noticeable, irregular and fast but because of those factors it keeps saying that the measurements' quality are low. i do also like though how it can connect to your health apps and give more information. all in all i think its a good app
30 August, 2023 at 3:26 AM
Hello, thank you for your feedback. Your heart condition can indeed affect the accuracy of your measurements. We hope that our app will continue to benefit you and help you learn new things about your health.

I didn‚Äôt know about the importance of measuring HRV before this app, and it has been enlightening when syncing with my apple watch and health data. I wish it had more insights of my cycle as a woman. I had had questions and the team is very responsive and nice. For nerdy people about body, stress and performance is amazing. And they are constantly improving it. It‚Äôs expensive but I‚Äôve found it worth it :)
29 August, 2023 at 9:43 PM
Hi there, and thank you for your review and kind words! It means a lot to us. Please note that you can synchronize data from other apps with Welltory, and track your body conditions throughout the cycle. You can also add labels about your state to your feed, and this will also be reflected in your feed and journal.

28 August, 2023 at 7:14 PM
Hi, and thank you for your feedback. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. The app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc., to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g., personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to remove the monthly plan from all platforms gradually, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Sch√∂ne App aber zu teuer
AllyMcBeal77
Eine App mit guten Einsichten in meinen K√∂rper. Sch√∂ne, ansprechende Aufmachung. Am Besten gef√§llt mir der Energie-Level, der bildlich dargestellt wird und in der Regel immer mit meinem eigenen Empfinden √ºberein stimmt. Man bekommt √∂fter ‚Äû30% Off‚Äú angeboten, die ich gerne in Anspruch nehmen w√ºrde, allerdings wird eine komplette Eingabe der Kreditkartendaten f√§llig und l√§uft dann irgendwie nicht mehr √ºber den App Store. Da ich nicht wei√ü, ob ich dann das Abo wieder einfach k√ºndigen kann, lasse ich es lieber. Zum vollen Preis ist mir die Vollversion zu teuer.

I love this app. I got it on the start of my health journey and can see how my health stays high even when my stress and energy are low when it didn‚Äôt in the beginning. So my body is handling stress better than before, like exercising. ***the main thing I would like to change is a way to change your waking hours. I work nights and it‚Äôs always telling to get rest because I‚Äôm up late. It also thinks work is my home, I work in a 14 acre plant and if I walk to a different part it says I‚Äôve left home

Would love to have the option of subscribing on a bimonthly basis - annual subscription fee too high for me And you should adjust your subscription rates to the purchasing power of each country - as was the norm in the good old days Thus you will enroll a wide spectrum of subscribers instead of limiting thinly yourselves at the top higher end of the market Considering the statistical deviation from the average EU you could establish yourselves as the winner takes it all since you‚Äôll be the first one to do that
16 August, 2023 at 10:33 AM
Hello, and thanks for the review. As for the prices, your feedback is appreciated and noted. As for the subscription, our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we have decided to discontinue the monthly plan, so it's no longer available on App Store.

Only one thing which does not make sense! My coherence, it is always low! I wonder why! My heart and brain are almost never connect! Everything else is terrific! I really love welltory! 100% recommended ü§ç
15 August, 2023 at 2:53 PM
Hi there! Thanks for the feedback and for the high ratings. Coherence shows how synchronized your brain, heart, and respiratory system are. When your systems are synced up, you are less irritable, tend to think more rationally and work more effectively, are ready to make important decisions and complete complex tasks, and feel balanced in general. Better coherence may be achieved with breathing practices, such as coherent or deep breathing, as well as positive emotions and thoughts. Please contact us via in-app chat for useful videos that can help you improve the coherence scores. Take care!

Hello, thank you for your feedback! The main idea behind the ads is to showcase the app's functionality in the shortest period of time ‚Äî Welltory has lots of features and they are hard to squeeze into one promotional video. Therefore, our ads offer an artistic representation of all the features available in Welltory. While these visuals might be stylized, they remain true to the core functionality of Welltory.

I have been having some medical problems so I wanted to track my heart rate and other metrics. This app is very in-depth.

I have a I CD heart implant and I use this 3 to 4 times a day to make sure I‚Äôm on track and my doctor can check it too and I highly recommend the free version if you can‚Äôt afford the other version because I used the free version for a long time and it works just fine and really gives you insights into your health! Everyone should have this app!

Bonjour! Merci pour vos commentaires; votre feedback est essentiel pour nous. Nous comprenons l'importance d'une version fran√ßaise. Cependant, traduire l'application enti√®re demande beaucoup de travail et de pr√©cision pour garantir la qualit√© des informations. Si nous recevons suffisamment de demandes de traduction dans votre langue, nous l'ajouterons √† notre feuille de route. Concernant le tableau de bord, nous appr√©cions vos suggestions et chercherons des moyens d'am√©liorer la clart√© et la pertinence des informations pr√©sent√©es. Merci de votre compr√©hension.

Very interesting app
UJustMadeItWeird
Found this while looking for a similar app I used previously on my android phone years ago. I‚Äôm addicted to data, all kinds of data. Due to not caring and partying for 3/4 of my life with little to no exercise at all I have a lot of internet in my heart health especially. I‚Äôve used a few of the popular HRV or heart rate apps out there and none seem to give you the level of detail you get in this one. I use very few paid apps as I have like no savings and it‚Äôs hard to justify the cost. This app I feel is totally worth the price (especially with 35% off as I got it. Even my doctor likes it when I was talking to him about it. I read a lot of scientific studies beyond just what this app referenced and both those and my doctor agree that outside of his office or the hospital this is the most accurate measurements available without spending a fortune on fancy machines to check heart health. While it won‚Äôt make up for the years of neglect it will help to minimize the issues that I will have by keeping me informed. Best part is that you learn so much more than just a number from this app and it‚Äôs so easy to learn and use. You get great insights into the metrics it‚Äôs reporting to you so you can understand the numbers it tells you. It‚Äôs up to you to incorporate the results into your health plan but as they say, knowing is half the battle. I‚Äôm hoping to get the Apple Watch so my sleep and everything can be analyzed as well. No matter what using this won‚Äôt make my health worse so it‚Äôs worth it. Check it out, the free trial period will convince you to go ahead and buy the pro version. At under a hundred dollars a year, which is taxable as a healthcare expense according to my accountant, it‚Äôs one of the better tools you will get for your health for that amount. Most people spend more on coffee in a month than a year of this costs. I recommend this to anyone who wants to stay on top of their health.

Hi, I'm a fan of welltory. My Many Korean users around me are disappointed about the lack of Korean support. Nowadays, with AI technology, it is easy to have a multilingual translation system in the app. If Welltory has such a multilingual system, it will grow globally. Please add Korean or multilingual support. üôè

Hi, Currently, Welltory is not localized. The complete translation of the application is a mountain of work since we have a large amount of content. If we get enough requests to translate into your language, we'll add it to our roadmap for sure and probably translate it. Stay tuned for updates!

Hoi, en bedankt voor je review. Onze excuses voor het eventuele ongemak. Het is bewezen dat onze app na enkele maanden gebruik een positieve invloed heeft op de levensstijl en het welzijn van gebruikers. Het zelftrainingsalgoritme heeft tijd nodig om u te leren kennen, en hoe meer gegevens het heeft over de toestand, activiteiten en gewoonten van uw lichaam, hoe effectiever het wordt. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie mogelijk niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt en gepersonaliseerde inzichten biedt. Daarom hebben we besloten om het maandplan geleidelijk van alle platformen te verwijderen.

5 Stars! I very much appreciate the usage of the app especially when I have my Apple Watch on, and it tells me that something might be wrong with my heart or heart rate. It seems that this app is the most accurate of any app on heath. I do wish that their algorithms would sync to see when someone is in distress for longer than normal periods of time that it could notify someone in the medical community, as some people with limited incomes are probably not able to get the full benefits of the app.

Interessante Auswertungen
O2Kundin
Ich √ºberlege mir die pro Version zu kaufen, bin allerdings noch nicht voll √ºberzeugt, da sich in der Test Version f√ºr mich wesentliche Probleme zeigen. Die Daten sind sehr interessant und auch die eingeblendeten Tipps auf Basis der Ergebnisse finde ich sehr hilfreich. Allerdings funktioniert die Messung per Blitz bei mir √ºberhaupt nicht, der Puls steigt angeblich rasant an und stoppt nicht (Bei anderen Apps funktioniert sie tadellos). Die ‚ÄûWasserstandsanzeige‚Äú wird nur unregelm√§√üig aktualisiert (heute zB noch √ºberhaupt nicht), auch die manuelle Messung per Achtsamkeitsapp wird nicht geladen. Kann ich beides irgendwie beeinflussen?

29 July, 2023 at 6:23 AM
Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

This app is remarkable
Earthbear80
I can‚Äôt adequately convey how much this app has helped me improve my quality of life. I‚Äôve got PTSD and consequently, an overactive autonomic nervous system. It is hard for me to connect with my body and listen to the signals it is giving me. Enter Welltory, which has more or less become my ground-truthing barometer of self. I rely on it constantly, to inform me on if what I‚Äôm experiencing is, say, truly sickness, or if it‚Äôs just my stress levels wreaking havoc on my body. I‚Äôll often find I‚Äôm fine enough to do more exercise, as my body is in good shape and what I‚Äôm experiencing is just too much ANS activity and fight/flight/freeze response. And then, I feel better listening to the app informing me more or less on what is neuropathic pain, and what isn‚Äôt. Thank you Welltory - you‚Äôve changed my life for the better! I love the layout, the exams, the monitoring and the occasional research results you provide. I also love how you link to actual medical research, enabling me to always learn and grow.

App thinks I slept only 1.5 hours after being woken up by before midnight and never considered sleep after midnight. Major issue is having paid for an annual Pro version from email promo, confirmed by Apple Pay, had no upgrade to my app nor instructions on how to apply it‚Ä¶ many features from trial turned off, now just nagware. No response from company to promo email address.

I don‚Äôt know how they managed to get all the readings correct but it was definitely on point with how I felt physically mentally and emotionally. It analyzed my health and was given results to read.Explained what everything meant. Which was great. Also offers more if u subscribe which I will try to do soon. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can tell me about my health and help me to get myself on a more healthier road. Would definitely recommend this app.

I‚Äôve been feeling miserably stressed while sleeping in the middle of the night when I should be most relaxed and it‚Äôs been impossible to explain to anyone. When I wake up miserable every night and try to figure out what‚Äôs going on I take my blood oxygen (it‚Äôs great) and I have learned I no problem with afib. So this makes zero sense! Now I finally have solid evidence that there is something wrong. I‚Äôm obviously not happy about it, but at least it explains the situation and gives me something I can investigate and show my doctor. I can‚Äôt thank you enough.

L'algorithme d'auto-entra√Ænement a besoin de temps pour apprendre √† vous conna√Ætre, et plus il poss√®de de donn√©es sur l'√©tat, les activit√©s et les habitudes de votre corps, plus il devient efficace. Certaines fonctionnalit√©s peuvent ne pas √™tre disponibles initialement, mais deviennent accessibles √† mesure que l'application collecte plus de donn√©es, offrant des informations personnalis√©es. C'est pourquoi nous avons d√©cid√© de supprimer progressivement le forfait mensuel de toutes les plateformes, et il a d√©j√† √©t√© archiv√© dans l'App Store.

Thank you for the review! We understand your point about the price. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Great, helpful app but subscription cost is too high
Reotord
Super helpful and I could see paying for the advanced features, but I generally avoid any subscription based app service. I‚Äôd consider it but probably for about 70% less than it currently requests.
10 July, 2023 at 2:54 AM
Hi, thank you for your feedback! We understand your concern about the price. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Moderately helpful, but I wish there were more suggestions on how to improve numbers besides ‚Äòmeditate for ten minutes.‚Äô Also, I already have a subscription yet it constantly prompts you to upgrade and has a 40% off banner at the top pretty much every time you open the app. That should not happen on something I am already paying for.

If you‚Äôre serious about your wellness or simply curious about your health, I highly recommend Welltory. It was recommended to me some time ago and I use it to compliment a few other apps to monitor my response to life and stresses. As a highly sensitive person, Welltory helps me calibrate my physiology, so I can take care of my needs in a healthy way.

01 July, 2023 at 9:12 PM
Hi there! Welltory can give you a complete and accurate analysis of blood pressure. But please note that you can't measure your blood pressure with Welltory ‚Äî you'll need to use a blood pressure monitor. You can read about it in this article: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/3878866. If you enter your blood pressure regularly ‚Äî automatically or by hand ‚Äî you'll be able to track trends on charts or in the blood pressure log (monthly blood pressure report), see what impacts your results, and help your doctor understand how well your treatment is working.

Interesting feedback
4 Goldens
I'm a body systems nerd. I have worked out for decade including body building. Nutrition, muscle building, and knowledge of how the systems work are always important focus of research. Once I learned that I had auto-immune diseases that impacted my health, learning became more impacted. I was skeptical when I discovered Wellatory. I used it and over time it consistently correlated to my body's feedback and my mental state. There are times that it can't get a reading. I don't know if it's really an issue with me or Wellatory so I've reserved a star for that. Plus it always says I'm relaxed! That particular reading never varies and I don't think it works. I'm not always in a relaxed state. Overall, I recommend this app. It's worth the money for the information provided. I'm looking forward to rating it 5 starts in the future.
30 June, 2023 at 8:32 PM
Hi there, thanks a lot for the feedback! To make sure the algorithm used in our app knows about your condition, please, pass the test named "Health Risk Assessment Survey". You can find it in the Introductory Self-tests section. Also, it might be worth passing all relevant tests in the Health Self-tests section. To access these tests, go to Menu ‚Äî Self-tests. As per the messages that say that you're relaxed, please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We're happy to hear that we've been helping you monitor your health!

This app has been so eye opening at how poorly I take care of nyself it makes me be accountable for that. I‚Äôve ask my Dr and she recommends this also and with that I trust it because I tend to already fool the my results end up each reading and the best part is it‚Äôs free if you want more depth of your readings there‚Äôs a cost but it‚Äôs well worth the try and see you will rely on it also im always looking at my watch I have the face setting to this and it‚Äôs cool to see you blood movements not sure how to explain just check it out!

How
Eric,Marine
How do I pay monthly
27 June, 2023 at 1:44 AM
Hi there, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Additionally, some features only become available after you've been using the app for a while, and it has enough data to provide you with some personalized insights. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store. You can still choose from other subscription plans available in App Store if you prefer to manage your subscriptions there.

Insights
Annoyed..-///-..
The app provides great data and insights ‚Äî when I can read them. Wish there were settings to adjust the size / color contrast - maybe even a read view that turns longer posts into easy to read text. Parts of short one or two line posts are often underlined with a think colored line. On my phone it means the tiny font it‚Äôs typed in is crossed out so I can‚Äôt read it at all. Other than that- really love the app and the accompanying watch face.

Amazing insights and UI/UX!
Ana Sofia Pinho
I‚Äôm really enjoying this app! The insights create clarity and allow me to navigate my days better. I wish that we could note that we have ME/CFS to understand better its influence in our energy levels and better evaluate our intelectual capacity, as I sometimes don‚Äôt think that the results correspond to how I‚Äôm feeling. If you don‚Äôt have chronic fatigue, this shouldn‚Äôt be relevant to you. The team really put a ton of effort in all the interactions and the content to explain very thoughtfully and clearly each parameter.

Not sure
Shane_O_Mac42
It always shows me in the red even when I feel calm and relaxed.
20 June, 2023 at 6:41 AM
Hello, thank you for the feedback! There are several reasons why you might be getting high-stress heart rate variability (HRV) results. 1. You only have three manual measurements, i.e. you mostly have automatic (background) Apple Watch measurements. Apple Watch takes such measurements only when you're calm and relaxed, not moving and your heart rate isn't too high. This is the case when you're asleep but doesn't happen too often during the day. Besides, it might happen when you're calm but talking or doing something without moving much. These are not optimal conditions for HR) measurements, which might be the reason why you see high-stress results. That's why our data scientists recommend measuring manually. And you can use Apple Watch for manual measurements as well. Please use your watch for manual HRV measurements. 2. Another important aspect that should be considered is the time of the measurements. To see your baseline body state before any factors influenced it, our data scientists recommend measuring manually in the morning, 10-15 minutes after you wake up but before any other activities. And it's better to do it regularly. Please read how to take accurate HRV measurements here. This will not only show you how your body is doing when the day starts but will also help our algorithm interpret your other measurements during the day according to your baseline. Please note that it's normal that our energy depletes and our stress level increases during the day after various external and internal factors affected it.

Great app with lots of daily insights
Eholiveira
I love this app! I decided to start getting fitness seriously last year and this app has been a great companion to guide me with daily insights about my health in general, including cardio and sleeping patterns, two of my main goals of improvement. i read a lot about HRV, a concept I didn‚Äôt have, and using it with my Apple Watch got me to improve dramatically my VO2Max, track stress levels during the day, which I can address immediately with meditation and breathing exercises, seeing the results right away in consecutive measurements. It‚Äôs really a good positive reinforcement to see that 5 min of meditation effectively reduced your stress levels! I wish though that there was a way to see the partial progress on daily goals. It‚Äôs a bit frustrating to only see the next day that you fell a bit short of a goal, something you could have addressed if you knew it‚Ä¶the day before! Just a minor improvement on a great, feature packed app, I totally recommend it.

Hallo! Danke f√ºr Ihre R√ºckmeldung! Wir freuen uns √ºber Ihre Bewertung. Die vollst√§ndige App-√úbersetzung ist ein Berg an Arbeit, da wir √ºber riesige Mengen an Inhalten verf√ºgen. Wenn wir gen√ºgend Anfragen f√ºr eine √úbersetzung in Ihre Sprache haben, werden wir diese auf jeden Fall in unsere Roadmap aufnehmen und wahrscheinlich √ºbersetzen. Basierend auf der monatlichen Zahlung zeigen unsere Untersuchungen, dass unsere App bei den meisten Nutzern innerhalb weniger Monate zu deutlichen positiven Ver√§nderungen in ihrem Lebensstil und Wohlbefinden f√ºhrt. Unsere App ist auf lange Sicht effektiver, da der Selbsttrainingsalgorithmus Sie kennenlernen muss und Zeit und Daten √ºber den Zustand Ihres K√∂rpers, Ihre Aktivit√§ten, Gewohnheiten usw. ben√∂tigt, um Basislinien zu erstellen. Dar√ºber hinaus werden einige Funktionen erst sp√§ter auf Ihrer Reise mit unserer App verf√ºgbar, wenn gen√ºgend Daten vorhanden sind, um Ihnen interessante Erkenntnisse zu liefern (z. B. personalisierte Forschung, die zeigt, wie sich zwei Datens√§tze auf der Grundlage Ihrer individuellen Gesundheits- und Wellnessdaten gegenseitig beeinflussen Quellen, die Sie mit der App verbunden haben). Aus diesem Grund werden wir den Monatsplan nach und nach von allen Plattformen entfernen und haben ihn bereits im App Store archiviert. Wenn Sie Ihre Abonnements lieber √ºber den App Store verwalten m√∂chten, k√∂nnen Sie andere dort verf√ºgbare Pl√§ne ausw√§hlen.

Insightful Health Tool

Welltory has a wealth of information and analytical data concerning your overall health. However, I feel there should be a little more clarity and explanation of the data being presented. Otherwise It‚Äôs a good tool to help you make some informed choices about your health and life patterns.

IDconnor
I have used the app for around 18m now and find it very insightful. However I‚Äôve only just realised the DRASTIC difference in readings compared to if taken lying down or sitting up. Eg lying down I always get full red alert readings and sitting up is more likely to be green and within range? No idea why, yet I‚Äôd advise all to test this and then ensure you take readings in the same posture for comparative consistency.
17 June, 2023 at 9:21 AM
HI, and thank you for the very detailed review and high rating! You're right ‚Äî we recommend taking measurements in the same position. As for the difference, it might be due to several reasons: different measurement accuracy score, changing balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of the autonomic nervous systems, taking measurements while lying down when your body state is shifting.

Accurate Health Insights with Notable Impact
BKP083
Welltory goes above and beyond when it comes to delivering health insights. The accuracy of their data interpretation is truly impressive. Other apps in the market often feel hit-or-miss with their health data analysis, but Welltory consistently matches my personal feelings and physical state, which is a testament to their advanced algorithms and deep understanding of health metrics. Moreover, the app doesn't just stop at providing insights. It educates users daily, sharing valuable knowledge that has led to noticeable improvements in both my physical and mental health. This feature not only fosters a deeper understanding of personal health but also empowers users to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and well-being. Despite the subscription cost, I consider it a worthy investment. The wealth of insights, education, and improvements to health far outweigh the price point. It's not often you come across an app that offers such a comprehensive and accurate health analysis. If you're someone who values their health and seeks to understand and improve it, Welltory is a must-have. It truly sets a new standard in health and wellness apps.

Ygeezy
I tried one other stress app before Welltory and Welltory for the win. I have only been using it for a few days but I love all of the informative tips and articles that are personal to where you are and real time actionable things you can do to change your stress levels. I have seen some reviews complaining about the price and to be honest I was hesitant. I think the app would be more accessible to people of different economic backgrounds with a monthly plan. That said, I decided to purchase because I want to see how stress is impacting my body since stress has caused illness for me in the past. There is a saying that what gets measured gets managed. So far, Welltory has been an effective tool for me to pay attention to my stress levels and do something about it.

Put in a find key so I can get blood pressure and heart rate
kentofcantubury
facing difficulty in navigating through the application. I can understand how challenging it can be to find the information you need, especially with a learning disability. It is great to hear that the application has been helpful in identifying your stress levels and other heart-related information. Perhaps one solution to simplify the information overload could be to customize the application's dashboard to your personal preferences. You could have your most frequently accessed data displayed on the main screen, and other data can be accessed through specific tabs. Additionally, a #search function could be added that allows you to type in what you're looking for and brings up relevant information. hopefully, the developers can take your feedback into consideration to improve the user experience for people with similar challenges in the future. What I really want is my heart rate I want my blood pressure and I want my sine wave function all in one place. It‚Äôs very difficult in the settings to use it. If you could enlighten me what to do, I would appreciate it. Eyes started studying hearts in the seventh grade.

Gives me a Baseline, particularly when I‚Äôm in doubt. Understanding how the nervous system works as a PhD who has gone to medical school, I can say it‚Äôs nice to have a system that I can measure specific levels that you can get at least a baseline of where you are. Keep in mind if you‚Äôre having a heart attack or stroke, it‚Äôs particularly hard for your nervous system to be balanced, so a system like this that can help you keep an eye on symptoms has been helpful.

Glad I have it. This app makes me more aware of my health. And I‚Äôd like more check-ins per day. My Apple Watch is always on but readouts are few. I‚Äôm lying in bed sick and the report shows all blue and says I‚Äôm focused and healthy. Time for exercise‚Ä¶ huh? But then. I‚Äôm Sitting in a meeting with my boss who is chewing out the room for 20 minutes and my graph comes back as totally stressed and im sick. So how can it be so accurate when I‚Äôm trying to hide being upset In a meeting - and it knows. But when I‚Äôm sick and tired it tells me it‚Äôs time to get some exercise and my focus is wonderful.

Hi there. Thank you for your feedback! We‚Äôre happy to hear that the app is useful to you. You can have symptoms and still have a high Health score. A high level of the Health metric can mean that you are doing fine even if you are experiencing symptoms. Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.

Everything you need !

In a health App : just needs a little individual tweak - Best Health App I have used for along time, it has everything you need in a health app, advice for learning about your condition, it even had topics on screen about heart conditions while you are waiting for your pressure readings. And it contacts easily with other tracks on health that you have so that you can get a good picture of what you need to do about improving your health.
