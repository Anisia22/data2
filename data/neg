Ich nutze diese App jetzt schon eine gewisse Zeit und bin √ºber die Ergebnisse schon ziemlich irritiert. Erst sind alle Werte gut und 20 Sek sp√§ter alle schlecht ?! üòÇüòÇ Zus√§tzlich wird mir oft angezeigt das meine Herzgesundheit bei 40 ( sehr gering) liegt und ich deswegen beim Kardiologen war. Beim BelastungsEKG meinte der Arzt, das schon lange keiner mehr, mit so guten Werten bei Ihm war. Alle anderen Untersuchungen waren auch ohne Befund. Diese App ist damit einfach nur Schrott und f√∂rdert ehr die Panikmache.

Neat Premise, Too Expensive
Eleanor1224
I found this app while looking for a blood pressure diary. I like that Heartify lets me log BP (it‚Äôd be even cooler if it could measure BP itself, but I know the tech isn‚Äôt there yet‚Äîsomeday!) while also providing a lot of additional information via the finger scan, but after trying premium for two weeks (plus the initial three-day trial) I just don‚Äôt think the value is there, at least for me. If it were $6.99 a month I‚Äôd keep it for a while, but the weekly charge feels greedy and excessive.

New MAJOR Bug
dhwuh
While they may be correct when using camera readings, when using Apple Watch data from Apple Health, your calculations of RMSSD & PNN50 are incorrect. And, I suspect there is a problem with TENSION calculation as well. PREVIOUS MAJOR BUG-Resolved With version 2.3.1, the bug has been fixed! Heartify has excellent data presentation. Much easier to understand than apps from their competitors. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Perhaps, it calculates correctly if you use the camera for readings. But, the calculations using Apple Watch are totally wrong. For example, if you take a 5 minute Breathe sample and compare estimated Apple Health SDNN calculations to Heartify, they do not agree at all. Likewise, if you compare with competitor‚Äôs (Welltory) SDNN, Welltory agrees with Apple Health calculation & Heartify is way, way off!

Results says I am about to die
Klmnuio
While another heart app says I am doing excellent today, this one has me at deaths door and yet my health score is 36% higher than 38% of all men 60 - 69 years of age who are also using this app. Something seems a tad off to me.
22 September, 2023 at 11:54 PM
Your body is a complex organism, so there are a lot of parameters at play here. The Heart Score is a longer-term estimate of your heart rate parameters that does not change with every measurement. If the comparison chart shows that you are better than 38% of your age bracket, that puts you on the lower end of the parameters. The measurement, however, is something that changes throughout the day depending on what you do and how your body reacts to it.

18 September, 2023 at 2:26 PM
The stress level that can be measured through your heartbeat relates to your physiological stress. This is not limited to how stressed you feel mentally, but rather describes how much your sympathetic nervous system is activated due to such factors as exercise, psychological stress, lack of sleep, and so on.

Heartify measurements are never affected by whether or not you are a Premium user. The metrics shown in your measurements results depend on your heart rate variability and might be affected by things like mental and physical stress, overexertion, illnesses, and a number of medications. If you are experiencing poor HRV results across the board, it might be a good idea to talk with your doctor.

Dear user, there is currently no scientifically reliable way for apps to measure blood pressure without the use of additional devices. If you have come across apps that claim to do so, their advertising is most likely misleading. You can purchase an affordable arm-cuff type blood pressure monitor and record its readings in your Blood Pressure Diary in Heartify.

04 September, 2023 at 8:56 AM
Heartify uses PPG, the same technology that's actively used by many fitness trackers and pulse-oximeters. It reacts to subtle changes in the amount of light picked up by the camera sensor as blood passes through your finger under the skin. While it may give off false positives when you play around with other objects, our algorithm is fine-tuned so that it correctly processes measurements that are done correctly.

I used to test it every morning as it is recommended by the app in resting. One day while I was feeling okay it showed me terrible result and I noticed it is suspicious. I tried it right after and it showed me healthy result and then one more time and again low score and bad result. Guys this app produces results randomly. Complete waste of money and more important trust
03 September, 2023 at 4:57 PM
Assuming you are taking a measurement using the camera, it's important to keep in mind that your heart rate variability can be affected by your posture and breathing. Please make sure to keep the same position and avoid moving or talking during the measurement as per the instructions.

I have tested this app for a week with several times measuring per day for more accuracy. Yet when I was having palpitations it gave me a good rate of green lights on stress, tension etc‚Ä¶ Remeasuring within the next 2 minutes and it already gave completely different results. This is a review after a week of usage. Although all data presented in such a clean, beautiful interface, do question why all the research mentioned were was stated which, when and by whom.
25 August, 2023 at 10:06 PM
We're sorry you didn't find Heartify to your liking. When measuring, make sure that you maintain the same posture and avoid moving or talking at all during the measurement. The stress, energy, and tension readings rely on several parameters of HRV that are sensitive to minute changes such as your breathing patterns.

24 August, 2023 at 7:59 PM
This is a common misconception that if the sensor gives false positive reactions on inanimate objects, then it is inaccurate. Actually, the app uses the PPG technology to measure your pulse and heart rate variability - the same technology that is used in many fitness trackers and pulse-oximeters. The algorithm that analyses the measurement is heavily optimized towards real measurements taken from your index finger. So, while you may get a reaction from a sensor on your t-shirt, the app would return an accurate result on a real measurement.

√úbersetzung mangelhaft
SilviaTL
Man muss sich dar√ºber im Klaren sein, Sasses sich um eine Momentaufnahme handelt! So kann man an einem Tag gute und sehr schlechte Werte haben. Auf welchen Wert sollte man sich also verlassen? Ausserdem ergibt der Wert ‚ÄöBetonen‚Äò keinen Sinn f√ºr mich. Wie lautet die Englische Originalbezeichnung?? Auch heisst es auf Deutsch ausgeruht und nicht ausruht.
07 August, 2023 at 2:09 PM
Wenn Sie mehrere Messungen durchf√ºhren, bedenken Sie, dass sich Ihr K√∂rper st√§ndig ver√§ndert und die Messung tats√§chlich eine Momentaufnahme der Parameter Ihres Herzens in diesem Moment ist. Um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Messungen korrekt sind, versuchen Sie, w√§hrend der Messungen ruhig zu bleiben und die gleiche Position beizubehalten. Was die √úbersetzungen betrifft, bedeutet der von Ihnen erw√§hnte Parameter ‚ÄûStress‚Äú. Wir werden uns auf jeden Fall auf die Qualit√§t unserer √úbersetzungen f√ºr Deutsch konzentrieren.

I spotted my boyfriend using this today - only out of interest - and I have many many things to say. My boyfriend has Atrial Fibrillation, has been cardioverted and ablated with mixed success and is now back out of sinus and in AF. His health is poor, he is exhausted constantly and needs more procedures. So imagine both our shock when this absolute disgrace of an app says ‚Äòyeah, heart heath is great‚Äô. I am in possession of his Echo reports and ECG‚Äôs and can tell you that is a lie. This app is a joke and should be labelled as such as it is dangerous and misleading. And before I see a developer comment stating, ‚Äòoh, the camera is good at this blah blah‚Äô, I would like to add I am a Coronary Care Nurse. I do this for a living. It‚Äôs my job. Do not waste your time with this; if you have concerns for your heart health or feel anything out of the ordinary, visit a medical professional and get an ECG done at the very least. Thank you
06 August, 2023 at 12:04 PM
You are right on one thing: you should definitely rely on health professionals with a wide range of diagnostic tools if you have any major health concerns. It is not possible to detect arrhythmias or AFib using the signal from the phone's camera and Heartify does not claim to do that. What Heartify can do is help users with their daily monitoring of their heart rate and HRV, as well as learn about how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Heartify uses only the necessary data to provide you with the best service. We use basic information such as gender and age to determine your heart rate brackets. Data that is imported from Apple Health is used to create and analyze your heart rate measurements from the Apple Watch if you have one. Usage statistics are anonymous and are only used to improve the app. Personally identifiable information such as your name or e-mail address are not collected inside the app.

07 July, 2023 at 8:40 PM
Hi Iven! It's great that you are curious about the measurement process. Like all devices that use the PPG technology, your camera might pick up false positives, however, the algorithm that processes input from the camera is heavily optimized to work with a human index finger. In short, yes, the camera might pick up additional signals, but that does not affect the quality of measurements that are taken correctly.

24 June, 2023 at 4:06 PM
Heartify uses a technology called photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure your heart rate. It is the same technology used in pulse oximeters. Our internal tests have shown that heart rate measurements are on par with the Apple Watch, which is widely accepted for its accuracy. Can you share what tools you used to take the measurement you compared it to?

When you take your first measurement, please note the instructions on the screen that show how to apply your index finger (and not the wrist) to the camera. The instructions will also show which camera to use if your phone has multiple cameras.

Dirty your Camera for What!?
A Bro with Common Sense
I was trying this out to see if this was legit or not. I have an Apple Watch Ultra which can definitely read my heart pulse very accurately according to research by Apple and doctors to make the heart rate sensor very accurate. The app starts you off asking you to pay $3.99/month for ‚Äúextra features‚Äù and you don‚Äôt have to pay for it but it tries to convince you. When you go to scan your heart rate, you put your finger on your camera which can‚Äôt read your heart pulse. It just black or really dark red. It can‚Äôt see my finger. It said I was getting 90 bpm (heart rate), but on my Apple Watch Ultra, I was getting 68 bpm (heart rate). The people behind it just want you money and looking at you skin on your finger won‚Äôt do anything. Don‚Äôt try it, and don‚Äôt pay for it.

The measurement technology is the same one used in pulse oximeters and many fitness trackers. It picks up on subtle light changes as blood passes through the vessels in your finger. While the PPG technology can give false positives on other objects, the algorithm that analyzes your heartbeat is optimized towards correct measurements using the index finger. Be sure to give it a go and take a proper measurement to see what it shows!

The PPG technology that takes your heartbeat works by registering small light changes inside your finger as blood passes through it. The same technology is used in the pulse oximeter in your doctor's office. While it can give false positives on other objects, our algorithm is heavily optimized to accurately analyze data from your index finger when you do take the measurement correctly.

Paul8.8.8
I‚Äôve been using this app for over a week and I do not trust it. It tells me I have no energy, I‚Äôm overstrained, tense, overstressed, with a poor health balance and 18% energy. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve slept well, exercised well, ate well, and I feel awesome, energetic and ready to take on the day. But if I were to trust this app, I should climb back under the sheets or as the app says, ‚Äúyour indicators don‚Äôt look good. Your body is using up a lot of its reserves, which can make you vulnerable to illness. Spend some time on self-care in a calm environment and take more measurements late.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and I feel amazing.
26 May, 2023 at 10:47 PM
Hi! First of all, good to hear that you‚Äôve been taking care of yourself. Heartify measurements are based on heart rate variability, which can give an insight into the workings of your nervous system. When you get a low energy reading, the sum total activity of your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is on the low end, and this can point not only to the way you are feeling right now but also to underlying processes in your body, which might be telling you that your self-care regimen is much needed.

Misleading app
dr.reno-nv
I found this app is misleading in the core features that it provides, and I here are the reasons 1. HRV: it‚Äôs fine to use camera to measure heartbeat rate, roughly, but when it comes to HRV, it fundamentally requires accurate reading of RR intervals in milliseconds. The app shows those ms values but that is simply cheating because the blood flow pattern is simply not able to tell that by nature. 2. Tachycardia: the test result tells me how many Tachycardia beats are found. This is just a JOKE and it made me question if the people behind it actually understand the fundamental concept of those medical terms. Look, a PAC beat can trigger a very short RR and a very long one following, are they signs of Tachycardia? 3. Stress level: HRV can tell many things (if the app could get them accurately of course), but a direct link to stress level is just WRONG. There are dozens of factors affecting HRVs, stress is merely one of them. To those who do not have fair understanding about those concept, this app is very misleading, and to those who do, this is more like a JOKE. That‚Äôs my 2c Cheers
17 May, 2023 at 10:43 AM
Thank you for trying out Heartify, we are always open to feedback. Several studies have shown that PPG measurements of RR intervals correlate closely to ECG measurements. Further, we have internally compared our results with the Apple Watch, which is acclaimed for its accuracy. Naturally, ECG monitoring is still superior to PPG methods, but Heartify allows anybody to measure their heart indicators at home and keep an eye on their health between doctor visits. In the heart rate chart, we analyze heart rate intervals from the pulse data and mark them as high heart rate if they match the definition for tachycardia. As for stress level, there are several accepted ways of estimating physiological stress level based on the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems derived from RR-intervals. Our aim is to help our users become more aware of their heart health and of course, we always advocate staying in contact with your medical team for a precise heart health evaluation. If you have further ideas on how we can improve our app to make it more precise, we‚Äôll be happy to see them at support@heartify.io.

Wrong info
Amk20123
It was telling me that your normal heart rate should be 56-86. Or something close to that. That is NOT correct. Your normal heart rate is between 60-100. Bottom line. So whatever algorithm that is used for this app will give you incorrect findings. You have to plug in the right info to get correct findings.
16 May, 2023 at 11:01 PM
The heart rate chart in your measurement result shows the percentage of heartbeats that are reaching the upper limits of the norm. The definition of elevated heart rate when at rest can vary and start at 90 beats per minute.

The way this technology works is by picking up on subtle light changes as blood passes through your finger's vessels. While it might give false positives on other objects, our algorithm is heavily optimised to be used with a human finger, so go ahead and give it a try!

This app is good but it doesn‚Äôt really do much like this app does stuff that we could go to other apps for and that app would also have more so try adding more stuff that‚Äôs useful that other apps don‚Äôt have and next time someone‚Äôs rating will be higher.

Fluctuating Results

I compared this to my Garmin watch and HRM chest strap. The results are sometimes 40 BPM out. My Garmin held a steady 60BPM, but this app had a range of 48-105 within one single test. I‚Äôm not convinced about the accuracy of the app.

Dear customer, if you are experiencing crashes, please describe the circumstances so we can investigate and fix the issue. As for the readings, we use a widely accepted technology called PPG which is the same as used in many fitness trackers.

I have heart issues it doesn‚Äôt work
US Marine of 12 years.
I have heart issues which also cause my heart to beat at 120+ (130-155 avg) the app claimed it was at 58 and then 66, so on so forth. I also trained in medical as well as I‚Äôm a musician in which I can count beats accurately and estimate heart rate I also used my heart monitors/blood pressure machines and they all were the same number (133-148) and no I didn‚Äôt use the app wrong. The avg human heart rate is about 50-90 and this app ‚Äúestimates‚Äù those numbers because it‚Äôs most common in humans. Oop Apple Watch just notified me to take my heart medication meaning I haven‚Äôt taken the medication yet (heart rate abnormal due to lack of medication) so please don‚Äôt use this app. Get a blood pressure machine that calculates or simply count it yourself (do it a couple times and if get roughly the same number you are doing it right. Easiest way to do it is count for 10 seconds and multiply my 6 or do it for 30 seconds (more accurate reading) and multiply by 2. Then add roughly 20 beats (for when you are rolling in bed or simply making dinner) or subtract 10-20 beats for when you are sitting down. Remember when counting your heart rate will fluctuate which is why I‚Äôm saying this. When counting make sure you have been sitting for a few minutes, do not make a fist, relax and count. Thank you and I hope this actually reaches someone who may need to see their doctor due to irregularities in the heart beat (shouldn‚Äôt be above 90 but definitely talk to your doctor if it‚Äôs above 120 normally) if so just ask to be put on propranolol and you‚Äôll be set (unless there is an underlying condition such as mine)
12 April, 2023 at 6:35 AM
Thank you for the detailed review, and first off, we are always glad when our users get health checkups by professionals. And any decisions on medications should always be left to the healthcare provider. Second, we're constantly upgrading our algorithm for more precision and your report is frankly surprising. Do you perhaps have other devices that you can compare Heartify's measurement to? We'd be grateful if you could send a detailed report to support@heartify.com because we'd like to get to the bottom of this problem.

Il finto gratuito
Antomobile
Solita App ‚Äúfinta‚Äù gratuita, che scopri non appena finito il download e inizi ad usarla. Solo tre giorni gratis‚Ä¶ poi 7 euro a settimana‚Ä¶ con addebito automatico. La scorrettezza √® non dirlo subito, prima di farti scaricare inutilmente circa 300 Mbs per veder apparire - in maniera abbastanza subdola - la richiesta di addebito automatico. Credo Apple dovrebbe imporre agli sviluppatori di comunicare costi e condizioni commerciali prima di scaricare le App (le statistiche di download ed uso sarebbero pi√π veritiere)

I wanted to test this to see if it‚Äôs real but your phone can‚Äôt sense heart rate but this app is coded to say random numbers when it sees skin on camera. When you hold your hand away not touching your phone it says that it‚Äôs working dont fake stuff like this saying your stressed. Don‚Äôt believe this app.
11 April, 2023 at 6:27 AM
The technology used in Heartify is called photoplethysmography (PPG) and is the same method used in the pulse-oximeter at your doctor's office and in many fitness trackers. The way it works is by reading the subtle changes of light as blood pulses through your finger.

Literally every single time I used it; even in perfect health, the app told me I was very close to becoming ill. This is frustrating because; although deemed as not meant for medical use, someone with anxiety may go down a rabbit hole using this app. Please if you are an anxious person regarding your health do not use this app, it is just an app measuring through a camera, a doctor result will have far more answers for you!

Why is Premium so expensive?
McWeiss
Seriously. 6.99 per month would be expensive, but per WEEK? That‚Äôs just ridiculous‚Ä¶ Our society just destructs itself by greed right now. So sad‚Ä¶ The app itself is good, but who knows how accurate it is. It would be nice, if the different values would be explained a little more and what it means if certain values are higher/lower than average.

Dear Customer, Can you please elaborate on what you disliked in the app so we could address it? Heartify uses scientifically proven technologies for measuring your heart rate. PPG for measuring your heart rate, and HRV (heart rate variability) to estimate your heart health metrics. Further, all subscriptions and trials are protected via the App Store, which means complete transparency of all purchases.

Furthermore, there is ample research on heart rate variability that we use to gauge your physical state through your heartbeat.

Data reporting is crap
TurkeyLeggOriginal
First of all, it doesn‚Äôt matter how good your measurements are, the app will tell you that you‚Äôre dying. My numbers are perfect, but because they are so far above average (good), app gives me a low heart score. I‚Äôm not in the average range in PNN50‚Ä¶.0.0% (off scale to the good side) and my Coefficient Of Variation is also. But the app tells me I‚Äôm dying. I guess this isn‚Äôt for people who run 5 miles almost every day. Hopefully the actual measurement data is correct.
19 February, 2023 at 7:40 PM
Hi there! Please update to version 2.1.8, it looks like a bug has led to heart rate measurements being higher than in reality, we've fixed it now. Thank you for your patience.

Should I have a Friday every day?
Amylby
I am embarrassed. When I feel great and energized, the app shows that I'm stressed, my systems are weak, my health parameters are lower than those of people in my age group, etc. It looks like I'm dying. But when it was Friday, I woke up on Saturday completely broken with a headache and other consequences and dysfunctions of the body after the party, the application shows that I am great and better than the other 80%. So, should I have a Friday every day? Or the app also considers the day of the week? If yes, so this is a good result to be better than other 80% on Saturday:)

Analysis of 3 days use
zuperpana
+ Easy to use + Nice user interface + Fun with all stats + Fun to compare my result with other people + Great to tack control over my stress level + Great information about HRV - Tension parameter, how is it calculated? And how can a person reduce it? Mine is always between 35-45% and it is to high - the heart score % how is it calculated? I have reduced my stress level and also measure during the night. However with very low stress level and energy level that I guess is common when eg reading a book my tension is still around 40 % and it makes my heart score go down to a low score about 45%.. which is not good for the heart score progress bar.. Conclusion this information on the minus side is something I need to now to use this app in the long run. However, otherwise great job!!

03 January, 2023 at 2:03 AM
Let me correct you there. You can always measure with just the phone's camera -- we use trusted PPG technology and our own smart algorythm to detect your heart rate and calculate your HRV. However, we do also offer Apple Watch support for users who have it. The main difference is that the watch takes measurements automatically throughout the day, while if you use a camera, you will need to check in to measure manually.

This looks like a bug on our end. Have you waited until the "Calibrating" sign is off? When the measurement starts, for the first few seconds it adapts to the information and should provide accurate readings after a couple seconds, provided you do not move.

25 December, 2022 at 7:29 PM
While we can commend you on your curiosity, some of what you said is not true. Heartify uses PPG technology, the same used in your doctor's pulseoximeter, to take your heartbeat information. What it does is shine the camera's light to highlight your blood vessels and then register the subtle changes in your capillaries' color as oxygenated blood passes through your blood vessels. While it is true that the camera can pick up light changes from inanimate objects, the Heartify engine is optimized to properly estimate heartbeat in living human subjects.

It‚Äôs completely fake, tried it on a piece of red paper and it gave it read a pulse, there is no way a phone can measure your pulse or energy levels. Don't believe apps like this that claim to read people.
20 December, 2022 at 4:48 PM
Hi there, curious mind! While we appreciate you taking the time to find out how the app works, your conclusion is far from the truth. The technology we use is called PPG, which uses the camera sensor to pick up on light changes. If you hold it up to a piece of paper, it is likely to also pick up light changes and show it as heartbeat. The key part missing from your experiment is that Heartify is optimized to be used with your index finger, and not with paper, balloons, sausages, or other objects without a pulse. This means that it is geared towards analyzing the patterns of human pulse, while the "pulse" received from your experiment will not be analyzed properly.

Camera light comes on as soon as you launch the app. This is a comically stupid feature, since I and the majority of users of this app have an Apple Watch. Make the manual measurement with the camera lens a feature that‚Äôs optional in the app and not mandatory as soon as you open the app. You lost a potential paid subscriber because of this silly feature. It‚Äôs annoying and unnecessary.
11 December, 2022 at 10:06 PM
Dear Customer, Heartify allows people to track their heart health without needing to buy or wear an Apple Watch or other gadgets. The measurement automatically begins on startup so you don't forget to track your health consistently. However, you might be right in that device users do not need a measurement on the start, since the watch is doing this for them. We are working on changing this in one of our future versions, so stay tuned!

Per quanto riguarda gli smartwatch, Heartify aiuta le persone a monitorare la salute del proprio cuore senza acquistare un gadget costoso.

Heartify te ofrece una versi√≥n gratuita y una versi√≥n Premium que incluye una prueba gratuita. Lo m√°s probable es que te hayas suscrito a la versi√≥n de prueba y no la hayas cancelado antes de que comenzara la suscripci√≥n.

Charged me $7.55
RonnyGreen
They just charged me $7.55 when it says it is a free app. I‚Äôm trying to get a refund and so far haven‚Äôt been able to. Calling Apple right now to cancel the charge.

Dear Customer, The app offers a free 3-day trial of the full version and can be used for measurements without any charge. Like any other trial or subscription, the Heartify trial is controlled via the App Store, which means that we cannot possibly charge you without your consent, and that we cannot cancel your subscription remotely. Most likely, you signed up for the trial and then were automatically billed when it ended.

My daughter suffers from SVT and when her heart was going at least 3 beats a second this detected her heart rate at only 90 bpm
21 November, 2022 at 7:46 PM
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We aim to take correct readings for everyone, so we'll try to look into this. Can you let us know if the heart rate chart (where it shows your pulse with a bar chart) in the result detected any tachycardia?

Nette Idee, aber Pulsmessung √ºber Kamera ist komplett unzul√§ssig. Die Ausschl√§ge sind gro√ü, egal wie still man sitzt. Dazu kommt ein nerviges Vibrationsger√§usch zur Verdeutlichung des Pulses, was aber doppelt so oft wie der Puls kommt. Die Auswertung ist widerspr√ºchlich, in einem Satz steht was von fehlender Energie und im n√§chsten dann, "wow, man ist voller Energie".
15 November, 2022 at 10:34 AM
Sehr geehrter Kunde, die PPG-Technologie, die in Heartify zum Einsatz kommt, hat sich in verschiedenen Bereichen bew√§hrt und wird h√§ufig in Pulsoximetern und Smartwatches verwendet. Nat√ºrlich gibt es genauere Methoden, um die HRV einer Person zu bestimmen, aber die meisten davon erfordern das st√§ndige Tragen spezieller Ger√§te oder Messungen in einem professionellen Umfeld. Die Messung mit der Kamera kann den Menschen helfen, ihre Gesundheit zu √ºberwachen, ohne dass zus√§tzliche Ger√§te ben√∂tigt werden.

Took three different reads didn‚Äôt do anything different they were three minutes apart. Don‚Äôt think this is actually accurate at all. Go to your doctor to get your heart checked.
13 November, 2022 at 11:46 PM
Thank you for the review. Assuming you followed all the instructions and were still in the same pose, sometimes your breathing and nervous system can change your heart rhythm and produce different results, even in a short period. In that case, we recommend taking a look at the RMSSD and SDNN values to see if they are similar across all three measurements. If you find they are very different, please drop us a line at support@heartify.io and we can try to get to the bottom of this.

Nu stiu cat de buna e aplicatia pentru ca daca lasi telefonul pe un birou de culoarea maro deschis, am incercat sa las si pe culori ca albastru si rosu si aplicatia incepe sa testeze, iar in timpul testului, genereaza date. Asa ca biroul e foarte stresat si cu mai putina energie si chiar are puls. Puteti si voi sa incercati. Cu alte aparate nu am testat ca sa vad daca indica aceleasi valori. Pentru design-ul si gratuitatea aplicatiei dau 3 stele

Told me my RR was 35 which is dangerously high. Done a bit of research and then read reviews and after reading them decided to take my measurements using my thigh, my knee then my elbow and surprise surprise it took a reading I all these areas. Not only a con but a dangerous con playing on peoples health anxiety

False results
Nekshan1
May be not false results, but I found it interesting that the app gave a perfect reading when I place the camera over an orange fabric placed on a pillow. Is there any reason as to why this may be? Until then I give the app a star which I feel is too much star.

Welltory stellt viele relevante Daten und Ableitungen daraus √ºbersichtlich dar und gibt Hinweise wie darauf zu reagieren ist. Mit wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten belegt, ist auch alles nachvollziehbar. Mit dem Teil bin ich sehr zufrieden! Aber: jeden Morgen bekommt man 3-4 Push-Benachrichtigungen, wovon eigentlich nur eine relevant ist, wenn √ºberhaupt. Benachrichtigungen sind super, wenn es um wichtige Informationen zum aktuellen Gesundheitstand geht, aber alle anderen sollten bei Bedarf abrufbar sein und einen nicht schon fr√ºh morgens bel√§stigen. Hier w√§re es in der App selbst hilfreich, die Benachrichtigungsarten festlegen zu k√∂nnen, die man erhalten m√∂chte. Ironischerweise bekam ich einmal als Tipp von Welltory selbst, systemweit alle unn√∂tigen Benachrichtigungen zu deaktivieren, um mich weniger ablenken zu lassen. Well played, Welltory. Au√üerdem ist die App nach Jahren von Hinweisen in den Rezensionen immer noch nur auf Englisch verf√ºgbar.

Una de esas aplicaciones retorcidas que quieren dar un mont√≥n de informaci√≥n que te hacen perderte en tutoriales, consejos y zarandajas. Mucha venta, pero me extra√±a que aun no lo tengan en espa√±ol, con lo que aun se hace m√°s indescifrable. Lo que te dejan claro es que hay que pagar m√°s de 6 euritos al mes para obtener una buena informaci√≥n. As√≠ que, quiz√°s cuando se expliquen mejor y sea m√°s inteligible en castellano, la vuelva a instalar. De momento no me sirve.

This is a pretty nice looking but app. Many other apps are like this. Is it worth the yearly fee? No would be the answer . It will give you some data as other apps . However, if you shift work, then this app is not for you. It reports terrible sleep while your working and you to lazy to walk around when you are sleeping. It always indicates poor health or stress. Turn of the notifications because everything it reports is bad. It is not intuitive like some sleep apps are . Go to the gym and it reports your stressed and in poor health. Not worth what they are charging. Buyers remorse for sure. Support never returns emails. The support form is worthless. If you still want to buy wait for a discount. It‚Äôs still too expensive.

Hi there! We're sorry for this negative experience. Please, delete the app, reboot your smartphone, and reinstall the app again. This helps in most cases. Please note that you need to log in to your current Welltory account, by using the same account credentials (email address/Apple ID/Facebook/Google) you used when you signed up for the account. If that doesn't help, please email us to support@welltory.com using the email you provided when you signed up. We'll be happy to help.

If I listens to this app I would be a couch potato
Poweredbyurmoney
Was going to update my old review with more info but it seems to be gone. Anyway been using the free scan for months now and also using another free app. According to this app I was only ready for a workout once in the whole month of September. The app is to flashy and floods you with unnecessary information. I don‚Äôt know what they are using to Calculate things or if they never update your baseline but this is app is worthless to me. At this point I just find it humorous how wrong it is everyday. Don‚Äôt waste your money! Find the free one I am talking about. To be nice I am not naming it here! Devs no need to respond, you always say ‚Äúoh contact us to look at your data‚Äù I shouldn‚Äôt have to. Make a product that‚Äôs works if you want people to pay you for it.

Too much
Nremj
I like this app however it looks overwhelming. They should just show one day at a time and they should a summary button where you can check the previous days or compare. The app just shows everything and you need to scroll and scroll and next thing you know, it‚Äôs confusing. I wanted to cancel it but I‚Äôve already paid :(

No monthly subscription
Onyxomega
I hate being locked into a year long membership, and I think it‚Äôs ridiculous not to offer monthly subscriptions instead. I have ADHD, and I‚Äôve never used any paid app for a whole year, so a yearly membership means I‚Äôm paying for a year to use it for a month. This is a cheap sales gimmick, and it‚Äôs very frustrating.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Beware your payment methods, subscription, and data
erictm82
I subscribed to Welltory via their website. However: ‚Ä¢ The website is very buggy ‚Ä¢ It's very difficult to figure out how to cancel my subscription ‚Ä¢ I still don't know how to check whether my subscription has actually been canceled ‚Ä¢ I cannot delete the payment method I've stored on their server. ‚Ä¢ When I want to delete my account and all data associated with it, they warn me that "Deleting an account won't stop the subscription. Please cancel your subscription before deleting the account." Finally, there's no easy way to contact their support team, so I have to leave this feedback for others to beware.

No actualiza la informaci√≥n en el Apple Watch
AZKALASHNIKOV
Compre la versi√≥n premium para tener mi reporte en tiempo real, nunca se actualiza, hoy por ejemplo ya hice manualmente dos mediciones con mindfulness y sigo teniendo datos de ayer. Esto ya est√° as√≠ desde que adquir√≠ premium y no veo mejoras, la p√°gina de ayuda no da una soluci√≥n. No la recomiendo en este momento, pens√© que ser√≠a diferente pero teniendo las dos versiones, y viendo que l gratis te da lo mismo por no pagar nada esto es decepcionante por el dinero que cobran.

Vorsicht bei Kauf mit Rabatt
Kieselsalat
Achtung, wenn man ein Rabatt-Angebot √ºber die Website annimmt, erscheint das Abo nicht bei den Apple Abos, sondern verl√§ngert sich automatisch. Die K√ºndigung √ºber die Welltory App ist sehr versteckt! Bin leider drauf reingefallen weil man eben nicht von Apple rechtzeitig darauf hingewiesen wird, dass die Verl√§ngerung ansteht. Am besten direkt nach dem Abschluss sofort wieder k√ºndigen, damit man es nicht vergisst!

Interessant, aber nicht auf deutsch
jhofherr
Die App ermittelt interessante Daten und gibt hilfreiche Tipp. Aber gerade dieses medizinische Englisch ist dabei problematisch, sodass ich, und sicher auch andere, nicht alles verstehen. Bei dem geforderten Preis sollten andere Sprachen selbstverst√§ndlich sein. Dann gibt es auch mehr Sterne. Die Entwickler sprechen von viel Arbeit f√ºr die √úbersetzung, aber Preise von 70, 80, 350 Euro ist auch viel Geld. Da sollten schon mehrere Sprachen drin sein.

Leider nur zwei Sprachen
Luis de solee
Bei so einer komplexen App und einem Preis von 80 Euro sollte es m√∂glich sein das sie in Deutscher Sprache erscheint . Nicht jeder ist mit Fachbegriffen in englischer Sprache vertraut gerade wen es sich dabei um so eine komplexe App handelt. Komme gerne wieder wen Sie in deutsch angeboten und ich das auch verstehe was da gemessen wird.

Constant Negative Feedback
EveryNameITypeIsTaken1038472
I got this to track my sleep and stress. This thing NEVER has anything good to say! No matter how well-rested and energetic I feel, I get the feedback: ‚Äúyou need more rest‚Äù or some stupid rhyme about my stress level. Point being- it gives me the same negative feedback no matter how good I feel. I don‚Äôt think it even measures anything, just a tactic to get me to buy so that I can finally get all of that sleep they keep telling me I need more of.

Hi there, and thank you for your feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We also recommend relying on measurements with more than 95% accuracy and following our tips on how to take accurate HRV measurements: https://help.welltory.com/articles/3361520. If you try to follow our instructions but your measurements still show high-stress levels, you can contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem). Our support engineers will check your measurements to rule out possible technical issues.

Uses Fear Tactics and Never Works
Jdub110
According to this app I‚Äôve been on my death bed every moment of every day since I‚Äôve allowed it to view data. Maybe 1 in 100 updates won‚Äôt tell me how stressed and ill I am. Meanwhile Apple HRV is good numbers and I feel fine. App says it has these thousands of measurements yet only updates sporadically. Maybe once a day or six times a day depending on random probability. It‚Äôs also fairly useless without the subscription which is expensive for what you get and there‚Äôs no one time fee. Do not recommend.

Hi there, and thanks for your feedback. We're really sorry you feel this way about Welltory. We assume you are referring to automatic (background) measurements from what you describe. Generally, our data scientists recommend taking manual measurements along with automatic ones. We also cannot control the frequency of automatic measurements because it usually depends on your activity. By taking manual measurements regularly, you can control the measurement conditions and follow the tips described in our help article on how to take accurate heart rate variability measurements: https://help.welltory.com/articles/3361520. We also recommend relying on measurements with more than 95% accuracy. If you have any concerns or questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem). Our support engineers will check your measurements and will be happy to help you rule out possible technical issues.

Hello, and thanks for the feedback. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in the App Store.

Very Confusing
BeachLover1105
I have tried to understand this app and use it to help guide me but I just find it very confusing. In addition, no matter if I‚Äôm working out, working, running errands, or resting it constantly tells me to rest. Again even when I‚Äôm resting it tells me to rest. I feel if I followed the advice of this app I would be a couch potato.

Hello! Welltory tailors its guidance using the data it gathers. If the app tells you to rest even during those low-activity days, it could indicate that your body is strained and needs more time to recover fully ‚Äî but please note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. But rest assured, as your measurements stabilize, Welltory will adapt its recommendations. If you have specific questions regarding Welltory, please check out our help center articles, available here: https://help.welltory.com

Dont pay for premium
SeanaLyn
While the app itself is great I deeply regret paying $100 for the annual plan. I only did it because the app was confusing (i thought premium was needed for working with the Apple Watch which was incorrect) and it wouldn‚Äôt let me try it for one month. After purchasing I have discovered there is no benefit outside of getting ‚Äúai recommendations‚Äù which are just generic tips and articles that have no tie to your actual data. It‚Äôll say I need to relax and suggest meditation when my energy, stress, and health are all great. Or tell me to go for an intense workout when my health is listed as vulnerable. The worst is I get ads CONSTANTLY pushing me to upgrade to premium (I know you can pay even more for an actual human to coach but the ads appear to be just for what I already pay for). The ads and pop ups are way too frequent and very annoying considering I already paid $100 to upgrade. I do like the app itself but comparing my experience to my friends who use the free version the only difference is repetitive and unrelated tips. The free version is probably a 5 star but the premium is a 2 at best (hence the 3 stars). Already turned off auto renewal as I definitely will not waste my money again.

would love to pay monthly, also. but the weird fear of feeling like i‚Äôm dying every single day is very off-putting. it does not matter if i‚Äôm spending the day on the couch or on the go at work or at the beach. i‚Äôm always in the red. i wear a watch so it‚Äôs tracking all the time unless i‚Äôm asleep.

Hi, and thank you for your feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) shows physiological rather than emotional stress. It means that you might feel well but your body can be in stress from what you've been doing or any other factor. HRV is very sensitive to even the slightest changes in both external and internal factors, e.g. meals, news, walks, caffeine, hormone levels, etc. What's also important is if you only have the automatic watch measurements, this might be the reason too because your watch can measure at any time including when you're talking or moving a little, or right after a workout. All this can affect your autonomic nervous system and, thus, HRV.

Hi Steven! Please know that you can always reach out to us for any questions regarding your measurement results or subscription (in Welltory, open Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem). Your stress levels might be high for various reasons, and it's normal for this value to be higher after a workout or even a simple physical activity. However, please note that we measure physical stress rather than emotional. It's the degree of tension your body might be currently facing, and you may not necessarily feel this type of stress or know it's even there. It's why HRV measurements are so useful ‚Äî they offer a way to learn how your body is really feeling at the moment. You can read more about the variability metrics Welltory uses in this article: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4380824

I regretted this purchase. It is not well-grounded in science, despite the marketing hype. Readings rarely varied regardless of my status. Just expensive, time-consuming and not terribly helpful to me. Your mileage may vary.

Hi there, and thank you for your feedback. We are really sorry you feel this way about the app. Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely used to assess what‚Äôs going on with a person‚Äôs body ‚Äî there are almost 22,000 relevant studies on PubMed. You can find more information in our help article: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4380824. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.

Bugs
Army1981aa355038
I have been using this app for about two months now and have a few issues with it. The first is the apps time settings, l start my training very early in the morning, unfortunately the app records any activitie or readings taken in certain times frames / windows that are locked in and not dependent on your individual time zone for example l start my training and take my first reading of the day at around 0400 local time unfortunately this is recorded by the app as being taken in the late afternoon, the app should work off local time zones. Next is the ‚ÄúGeo‚Äù feature which displays incorrect day, month and year readings. I have contacted support about these issues and while the response is within 24 hours there is no real help given in addressing the issues, for the price of the app l would expect more. I will not be renewing my subscription. In response to your reply specifically the Geo feature, l,have already raised the issue via the help contact that was close to 3 weeks ago including at least one follow up email about the progress of address the issue, the amply feedback that is given is it‚Äôs a rare issue and is being looked into and no time frame can be given, however l am still paying for a feature that l can not use. I guess time will tell

Hello, we're very sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our app. The thing is that we have the following time range: morning time starts at 5 a.m., and ends at midday. The evening starts at 8 p.m., the night starts at 3 a.m. ÔªøWe understand that it might be different for some users, so we have plans to add a personalized schedule in the future. As for geolocation issues, they might take some time to fix but we always address them and try to improve the way we process this information.

Hola a todos. Gracias por tu comentario. Ten en cuenta que la variabilidad de la frecuencia cardiaca (VFC) no refleja tu estado de √°nimo o emocional. Medimos el estr√©s f√≠sico y no el emocional. Muestra c√≥mo reaccionan tu coraz√≥n y tu sistema nervioso a lo que te est√° ocurriendo y a lo que tu cuerpo est√° experimentando en ese momento. Por eso son tan √∫tiles las mediciones de la VFC.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months, while one month isn't enough to test all the features. Welltory is more efficient in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings ‚Äî e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app, or the monthly and annual baseline reports showing the dynamics of your baseline metrics. That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Hi there, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store.

Waste of $$$
spehanich
Don‚Äôt waste $$$ with @welltory noticed at the midpoint of my ride. That app was not tracking my miles. Switched to Apple activity app. That works just fine. Many other issues with Welltory. Very disappointing. Accidentally forgot to stop my work out. No way to edit workout data. Apple Health does a much better job of tracking and analyzing sleep than Welltory. You can do just as well by looking up health data on the web. Nice marketing. Lousy app.

Hello David, and thank you for your feedback. Several things might be contributing to such results ‚Äî low measurement accuracy, not following the recommendations while measuring manually (e.g. if you measure right after waking up, your body needs about 10-15 minutes to switch from being asleep to awake, and this is stressful from the physiological perspective), talking or moving during the automatic measurement.

Hoi, en bedankt voor je feedback. Metingen van de hartslagvariabiliteit (HRV) bleken nuttig bij het monitoren van de algehele lichaamstoestand en de manier waarop we met stress omgaan. Er zijn meerdere PubMed-publicaties over. Uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat onze app bij de meeste gebruikers binnen enkele maanden aanzienlijke positieve veranderingen in hun levensstijl en welzijn helpt bereiken. De app is op de lange termijn effectiever, omdat het zelftrainingsalgoritme u moet leren kennen en het tijd en gegevens over de toestand van uw lichaam, activiteiten, gewoonten, enz. kost om basislijnen te vormen. Bovendien komen sommige functies pas later in uw traject met onze app beschikbaar als er voldoende gegevens zijn om u van interessante bevindingen te voorzien (bijvoorbeeld gepersonaliseerd onderzoek dat laat zien hoe twee datasets elkaar be√Ønvloeden op basis van uw individuele gezondheids- en welzijnsgegevens uit de bronnen die u met de app heeft verbonden). Daarom gaan we het maandabonnement geleidelijk van alle platforms verwijderen en hebben we het al gearchiveerd in de App Store.

This app is very negative.
Michelle ODonnell Asbell
I enjoy reaching goals. Found I can be very competitive to do so. The fitness app on my iPhone started me down the path to close my circle!!! Then a friend told me about the Apple Watch‚Ä¶ so I got one!! Love earning badges and closing my circles! Then this app popped up‚Ä¶ said it would give more info. Ok, that it does‚Ä¶ but not encouraging info. You need to stand for three minutes each hour instead of one. Ok, I usually do that, so should not be a problem‚Ä¶. Oh! Problem! Two days ago I was up and moving for 22 out of the 24 hours‚Ä¶. It only gave me credit for moving 13 hours‚Ä¶. Yesterday I was up and moving again‚Ä¶. Apple told me 18 hours‚Ä¶ this app only gave me 9‚Ä¶. Didn‚Äôt meet their goal because they didn‚Äôt credit me for all of it. Things like this might ‚Äúencourage‚Äù others, but me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very discouraging‚Ä¶. I was so busy, so active, gave all I had‚Ä¶ and this app doesn‚Äôt give me credit. What‚Äôs with that. The harder you work, the less it gives‚Ä¶ but doesn‚Äôt mind telling me to watch my stress, rest more, move more‚Ä¶. Oh, have an organism‚Ä¶. Good grief‚Ä¶. Not excited about this app at all. I worked my tail off yesterday. Not really having anything to do with this app, but just life‚Ä¶ and I got very little credit for it!

This app is very unmotivating. I can‚Äôt use it. Its insulting. I want my $100 back. I reading do not accurately reflect my experience with my health check up and how a feel. It is so doom and gloom and gives out simplistic solutions to reducing stress. It is telling me Im stressed and low energy even when I am the exact opposite! Coming of a great weekend of relaxation and exercise and high energy, it didn‚Äôt even pick that up! Everyday showing Im in the red. I have regular physical and have not ever be diagnosed not felt symptoms of the so called high stress and low energy. I can‚Äôt stand this app. I wish you wou refund by money so I can invest in a health app worthwhile. I wish I could give you zero stars

Why do I have to pay $100.00 instead of the $8.33? It offers the $8.33 though you cant select it. I want to try it first but it is saying to pay the $100.00 first year and I don‚Äôt know if I would like the app first.

Hi there, and thank you for the feedback! We're sorry about the confusion. We show the monthly price so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e., it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. The reason is, Welltory has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app learns more about you. That's why we've decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it's already been archived on the App Store. We also offer a short trial period to new users, where you can try some PRO features for a few days. After that, you can continue using the free app version.

Waste of money
Greg1960!
This app is garbage. Basically cycles through a sequence of ‚Äúcanned‚Äù analysis and advice. Doesn‚Äôt appear to use all the data available to it either. Just a waste of money and useless.

Hi Greg, we're sorry you didn't like Welltory. It's worth noting that some of our more advanced features require a more extensive dataset to provide truly personalized insights. This process takes time to yield the most accurate correlations and recommendations for your personal profile.

An app made by developers, but not for them
hollyewhite
I‚Äôm not typically someone who reviews many apps, but I really want the engineers and other people looking to purchase this app to hear this. As a developer, while I appreciate the ambitious goals, they just aren‚Äôt realistic for someone who has to be in meetings or at a desk most of the day. Realistically speaking, the recommendation of 800kcals with 0 recommended exercise minutes on a work day is just unrealistic, especially if you haven‚Äôt had a great sleep the night before. There‚Äôs also a lot of repetitive and seemingly passive aggressive feedback like ‚Äúthat workout drained you, didn‚Äôt it‚Äù. No, it wasn‚Äôt the 30 minute yoga workout. It‚Äôs life that can be draining. It feels like I‚Äôm being shamed for my slow flow. Many of the phrases that are used and recommendations made can feel like back handed compliments or passive aggressive rather than positive motivation. It‚Äôs disappointing and frustrating, especially when you‚Äôre making progress. This app does not focus on progress, or even give you an opportunity to give feedback or personal reflections to understand if the feedback they‚Äôre giving is on point. I also would appreciate not being constantly asked to upgrade my app to a lifetime membership constantly. I turned off notifications all together because I‚Äôm tired of trying to be sold something I don‚Äôt intend on continuing and there‚Äôs no way to turn off this feature. While I do see some value in comparing how I feel to what my vitals say in Wellatory, I think an app like Gentler can help us make healthy progress, better decisions and provide better feedback overall without being so critical.

Why it‚Äôs not worth $100
Basilts1
This app is potentially very good, and I would pay the $100 price tag except for the following three issues. 1. Can‚Äôt read the graphs. Whoever decided to put dark gray labels on a black background shouldn‚Äôt be making design decisions. This alone is something that ruins it for me. I can‚Äôt see the time frames in the charts at all. 2. Inconsistent/contradictory data. I can take two readings an hour apart and one might tell me to take it easy, not workout, and not make any decisions today, and the next says I‚Äôm ready to rule the world. The problem is that the measurements are instigated by the user, so if I didn‚Äôt think to remeasure, I would spend my day being very careful and resting. I want to think that this is because the app needs to learn each persons baselines to be more accurate, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs really the case because it‚Äôs just a 3 day trial. Which brings me to the third problem. 3. No monthly subscription. If the app does what it says it does, I have no problem subscribing for a year. But 3 days is not enough time for the app to learn about me. Or maybe it never would? I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt try it long enough to find out. $100 is a little steep for ‚Äòjust trust me, bro‚Äô. If any of these three issues were addressed, I would subscribe. But until then I‚Äôll look for something else.

Hi, thanks for your detailed feedback, we really appreciate it. 1. I'll pass it on to our team. We're constantly collecting feedback from our users, and it helps us improve our app. 2. Please note that HRV doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment, i.e. Welltory measures physiological stress. Therefore, to see your baseline state, we recommend taking regular manual morning measurements 10‚Äì15 minutes after you wake up but before any other activities. You can still measure your HRV every day if you have a free plan. 3. You can always contact us from the app (Menu ‚Äî Settings ‚Äî Report a problem) to specify your questions about subscriptions.

App is fine. However there is no date of membership for the subscription and no way of cancelling on App Store or in the app. Beware before they take extortionate amounts from your account.

Not for Apple IOS
trblsmith
The app has a great deal of variability in its measurements with IOS health. Compared to other apps I use it‚Äôs almost completely the opposite. When I feel good it‚Äôs rates stress and sleep as poor. When I feel bad it rates my sleep and stress as good.

Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We also recommend relying on measurements that are more than 95% accurate.

Totally useless
Aaron 12098
I don‚Äôt know if it works for you, that‚Äôs great. For me it makes recommendations that are completely opposite of how I‚Äôm feeling and then when people complain about similar experiences online, the response is that what your body is different than how your feeling. It‚Äôs a waste of money. It doesn‚Äôt work for everyone and they should stop pretending it does.

Hi Aaron, Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after.

Vermutungen, keine Messungen
Romek1974
Ich kann nicht verstehen, wie man dieser App mehr als einen Stern geben kann. Null Sterne w√§ren gerechtfertigt, mehr nicht! Nachdem man sich die Pro-Version f√ºr viel Geld erworben hat, so wie ich, wird man trotzdem noch mit unerw√ºnschtem, nutzlosem Geschwafel vollgem√ºllt. Man ist mehr damit besch√§ftigt den M√ºll aus dem Verlauf zu entfernen, als n√ºtzliche Informationen zu erhalten. Doch damit noch nicht genug! Mir pers√∂nlich wurde st√§ndig angezeigt, dass mein Stresslevel viel zu hoch, mein Energielevel viel zu niedrig und mein Gesundheitszustand kritisch ist. Nun frage ich mich: Wie kommt es zu dieser Einsch√§tzung? Ich bin selbstst√§ndig und Sportler. Hei√üt also, ich bin fit und mein t√§glicher Stress ist √ºberschaubar. Ich stehe unter st√§ndiger √§rztlicher Kontrolle und f√ºhle mich gro√üartig. Die Angaben in der App sind f√ºr mich nur verwirrend, falsch und √ºberhaupt nichts wert. Ich wei√ü nicht wof√ºr diese App zweckdienlich ist! Ich w√ºrde daf√ºr gerne das S-Wort benutzen, weil es vollkommen gerechtfertigt w√§re. Allen die diese App in Erw√§gung ziehen, kann ich nur davon abraten. Diese App liefert nicht die Daten die ihr braucht. Sucht euch lieber eine andere App und verlasst euch darauf, was euer K√∂rper euch sagt.

Very interesting, but just OK in my opinion
Dano LV
On the outside the app seems really intense and full of extremely advanced features, but really the biggest feature the app provides is it‚Äôs heart rate variability monitoring. Other than that it basically just compiles the data from other Apple health apps and then sends you a bunch of suggestions. And the suggestions are extremely repetitive and annoying. Telling you ‚ÄúI know just what you need‚Äù. Sorry but that‚Äôs not possible, especially when everyone‚Äôs particular health situation is different, for a variety of reasons. It sends the same suggestions over and over again, even if you‚Äôve read them and done them. I was extremely excited when I purchased the subscription but after using it for over a month now I definitely wont continue my subscription‚Ä¶and probably wont even continue using the app.

I have a lifetime subscription so it‚Äôs beyond annoying that I can‚Äôt access this app now. I just get a black screen for the past week. A couple of times I was able to get in but right now just a black screen. I‚Äôve rebooted my phone several times. I‚Äôve considered deleting and reinstalling the app but I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôll lose all my data. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

Good app was better before
Izmo5617
I downloaded this app a yr or so ago maybe less & the free version was far more informative than it is now. It‚Äôs a good app w/ lots of good info BUT the info provided in the free version CURRENTLY leaves you w/ more questions & no understanding of your reading. The app could OFFER a MORE informative FREE version & still make people want to UPGRADE for the more indepth readings. With more free info people would have a better understanding of what is offered. To the PEOPLE BEHIND THE APP: You can PROVIDE MORE info & details to people WITHOUT GIVING IT ALL away and still get people TO WANT to upgrade. The lack of detail you provide currently makes me LESS LIKELY to want TO spend $$ on a membership because you don‚Äôt provide enough info for people to even begin to have an understanding of what you offer or the educational benefits of a pro membership. It seems MORE like a scam with so little info & LACK OF EXPLANATION provided. If more info were provided in the free version I‚Äôd easily rate this a 4.5-5. The only drawback is the time it takes to do the reading. Occasionally, its a reasonable wait time ( 2-3 min for the full in depth reading even 5 min from time2time). But it consistently takes 5-8min & I‚Äôve even had it take 10-15 min b4. That‚Äôs the only reason I wouldn‚Äôt rate it a full 5 otherwise. **CURRENTLY I RATE THIS APP A 2 DUE TO THE LACK OF DETAILS & INFO THE FREE VERSION PROVIDES.** the ONLY REASON it‚Äôs NOT a 1 (ONE) is because I know what it use to offer & have had the pd membership too. So I know it offers good info& is educational. Improve what you offer on the free app & it‚Äôs easily a 5 star app . ‚úåüèº

First app review
Latribri
I've never reviewed an app but felt compelled to in this case. Like others who have commented, the apps readings often contradict my the way I feel...I've read the response to Welltory on this so I'll skip that. The bigger frustration is the sometimes contradictory messaging. Last night my stress level was 36% at 9pm telling me "a good nights sleep is all you need." 9:37, I get a message to "take a break" while I was watching TV. At 10pm my stress increased to 60% as I was laying in bed getting ready to get a good nights sleep as requested. This morning at 6:31 I'm shown that my stress is 63% and "slow as molasses as burnout passes." shown that "I slept fine" (7h 22m) and then I'm told I could use some rest. There is likely some explanation for this neurotic set of readings but regardless the app should be easier to comprehend. I'm educated and as an endurance athlete and regular meditator I'm in above average physical health. This app would have me think otherwise. I'm certainly not going to upgrade to the paid version of incant trust the free version. 8/8/23 Update - today I visited the app for the first time in quite a while. My blood pressure reading of 117/83 is "alarming." That is pretty strong language (side note..."of concern" would be less dramatic while conveying the point), however the bigger issue is that everywhere I've looked suggests that that is not a low pulse pressure. Low pulse pressure is where your pulse pressure is one-forth or less of systolic pressure (not the case) and another source mentioned that a normal pulse pressure is between 25-40 which is the case. Using this app is causing me stress.

Makes You Think You‚Äôre Dying
Jessica V McKay
Everything in this app is framed from a negative, fearful perspective about what‚Äôs going wrong or what could go wrong in your body. Even if you get great scores, they come with warnings attached to them. If you‚Äôre at all worried or fearful about your health, this app will make you worry more.

Repeatitive some what funny communication
Scrat√∂
Welltory is a nice built app without bugs. The approach to give health information in a feed is nice idea. For the first one or two months the app gives you kinda funny phrases about your healt like ‚Äùsnooze with some blues: you slept ok‚Äù or ‚Äùmake like a sloth and just hang‚Äù. It‚Äôs funny once or twice, but after few months when you have seem the similar feedback over and over again it starts to be very annoying. Once you have learned to understand the graphs and the read your health data this kind of feedback is useless. Actually it makes you angry: I don‚Äôt want anyone to tell me what I should do, I can see it my self. Would be great if I could turn this ‚Äùfunny‚Äù feedback off and just see the graphs.

Trying too hard
MDM3000
The makers of the app are trying way too hard to fill a content pipeline and thus a lot of their posts are alarmist, repetitively telling the user they "might be coming down with something" because of an HRV level. Do we honestly think the user is coming down with something once or twice a week? I think they are taking a bit of data and trying to spin that into a driver for comprehensive lifestyle. Even they admit that data for HRV metrics is under-studied.

Hi there. Thank you for your feedback! We‚Äôll pass it on to the team. Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely used to assess what‚Äôs going on with a person‚Äôs body ‚Äî you can find more details in our help center. Generally, we advise relying on measurements with more than 95% accuracy, as when your measurement accuracy is high enough (95‚Äì100%), it means that the results on your screen closely reflect what‚Äôs going on with your body. To check your measurement‚Äôs accuracy, tap the liquid message opening the detailed information ‚Äî the accuracy score will be under the key insights. We also recommend taking manual morning measurements and following our tips: 1. Lie down or sit down with your back against the back of the chair. 2. Before taking a measurement, wait for 10‚Äì15 minutes to let your heart rate get back to normal. 3. Try not to move. Any movement affects your heart rate. 4. Don‚Äôt try to control your breathing, intentionally taking deep or even breaths. The way you breathe affects your heart rate, so just breathe naturally. 5. Don‚Äôt talk. Talking changes your breathing rhythm. Also, the technical quality can be low if the signal is unclear or if the image is blurred (for camera measurements). If you‚Äôre using a heart rate monitor or Apple Watch, make sure they fit tightly. If you‚Äôre using your phone‚Äôs camera, the image quality may be affected by your finger‚Äôs position on the camera and flash or the light intensity in the room (it should be neither too bright nor too dark). Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. However, if the quality of your measurements is high, they should reflect how your body's doing pretty decently.

Die App informiert mich √ºber das, was ich gesucht habe. Sie holt so viel aus den Daten der Apple Watch raus üòç Leider ist sie auf englisch.

Hallo! Danke f√ºr Ihre R√ºckmeldung! Wir freuen uns √ºber Ihre Bewertung. Welltory ist derzeit nicht lokalisiert. Die gesamte App zu √ºbersetzen ist ein Berg an Arbeit, da wir viele Inhalte haben. Einige Hilfeartikel haben wir bereits ins Deutsche √ºbersetzt. Auf Wunsch senden wir Ihnen diese zu, damit Sie sich in unserer App leichter zurechtfinden.

SUBSCRIPTION TRAP. CANNOT BE CANCELLED
Elidja268
Please beware that it will be impossible to cancel your subscription once you enroll. There is no such option on the app, or the website. No one answers the provide phone number. This is a lifetime trap unless your card provider works with you to prevent future charges. Subscriptions are typically cancellable with Apple through your purchases and active ones. However, this one is not listed. Almost as if you purchased it via the developer website. I am not sure how Apple allowed them to do that but it is how it works. Again, once subscribed it is impossible to cancel. For those who think i am just a dissatisfied customer, just pretend to cancel it and you will see why it is impossible. VERY DISHONEST APP.

Great app too many notifications
kjrj
Update: ****Beware this company now wants you location data. Don‚Äôt let them sell your personal and health information. Says they collect data but it‚Äôs not linked to you yet one of the items is your contact info. the developer apparently missed where I said I have all notifications set to off yet their app keeps sending them anyway. Unfortunately it‚Äôs just to annoying. It‚Äôs a really good app but just to spammy for what it cost. I also noticed that the app doesn‚Äôt seem to keep my data locally. It has to load every time, like it‚Äôs stored on their server instead of my phone. Not sure why. I really like the app and what it does as far as using my watch to monitor me and also when I scan I find it useful. However I have all notifications off on the app and I get several in the morning. Stuff I couldn‚Äôt care less about. Coffee is good for you and others so spammy stuff I don‚Äôt want. It also completely dominates your feed making it hard to see past results. You should make a free version with more features and your spam. I paid I don‚Äôt want to see all this crap or get notifications for random stuff. Just my health:
04 August, 2023 at 1:07 PM

Hallo, en bedankt voor uw feedback. We verontschuldigen ons voor enig ongemak. Het punt is dat ons onderzoek aangeeft dat de meeste gebruikers binnen enkele maanden na het gebruik van onze app aanzienlijke verbeteringen in hun levensstijl en welzijn ervaren. Het algoritme voor zelftraining verbetert in de loop van de tijd omdat het gegevens verzamelt over uw lichaam, activiteiten en gewoonten, zodat de resultaten op de lange termijn effectiever zijn. Sommige functies zijn in eerste instantie mogelijk niet beschikbaar, maar worden toegankelijk naarmate de app meer gegevens verzamelt. Om onze gebruikers beter van dienst te zijn, gaan we het maandabonnement verwijderen en is het niet langer beschikbaar in de App Store.

Promising but Needs Improvement
M_X_A
I was excited to try the Welltory app after seeing all the positive reviews. However, after using it for a few weeks, I'm disappointed with the overall experience. Here are some of my main issues with the app: The small print is difficult to read especially on a black background. The app keeps asking me to do the same tests over and over again without providing feedback. This is buggy, tedious and unnecessary. The app's advice is often contradictory. For example, one day it will tell me to rest, and then the next day it will tell me to do a high-intensity workout. I even offered to speak with the design team about my concerns, but I never received a response. Overall, I think Welltory has a lot of potential, but it needs some major improvements before I can recommend it to others. I would therefore wait until Welltory has addressed the issues I've mentioned before downloading the app. In the meantime, there are other health tracking apps that offer a more consistent and user-friendly experience. For example, if you're looking for a health tracking app that's easy to use and provides accurate advice, I recommend checking out Cardiogram. I hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment below.

Hi there, thanks a lot for your feedback! We're sorry you feel this way about your experience with the app. Could you please clarify what channel you used to request to speak with our team? To make sure our support team has got your request, please go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload. That way you can be sure that your message will be replied. As per the mixed messages ‚Äî we understand it can be confusing. However, this actually can happen indeed that one day you're suggested to workout, and next day you're suggested to rest. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. They may impact one another, but they‚Äôre not the same. For example, your body‚Äôs systems may be strained after a workout, while your mood is good. Likewise, a roller coaster ride will likely leave you feeling great, but it will also increase your stress level due to the adrenaline boost. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to keep tabs on physical stress: what you feel may not coincide with what your body is actually experiencing. When you‚Äôre not in touch with your body, you risk overdoing it and may end up with chronic stress or other health problems, such as frequent colds. If you need any help with understanding your HRV measurement results, feel free to read our helpful articles in the app or ask your questions. We'll be glad to help.

Over priced and over sold

I‚Äôve been using it for 5 months. This app has some interesting insights, but works inconsistently. Workouts are often missing. Suggested workouts are far off the mark. The Apple Watch widget is worthless, and looks / functions nothing like their advertised pictures.

Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

If I could put no stars I would. I had an issue with the purchase aspect of the app and honestly they stole my money so be careful cause I don‚Äôt see that it does anything and is a pointless app the watch itself does the same thing. I messaged what I could in the app no response thank so much for something you spend 100 f-ing dollars on that it wasn‚Äôt suppose to charge you. Thanks for all the help.

Data seems unreliable
IanTheGolfer
As a retired doctor I was interested in this apps insights but I‚Äôve been disappointed with some inaccuracies. I use an iPhone 14 and Apple Watch 6. The app has me as highly stressed based on the HRV readings but the app seems to have my average significantly lower than the data on the Health app on my iPhone. 19ms vs 31ms. I‚Äôve no idea why these are so different. I‚Äôve had a relaxed day today watching golf on TV and then at the cinema but Welltory says my stress levels are 80-90%. Currently I‚Äôm on the free trial and I can‚Äôt help feel that it wants to find problems so I fully subscribe. I‚Äôll try and take another hrv reading before I get out of bed to see what this shows as this seems to be the recommended time to take it. My resting HR is 52-63bpm. I worry the app actually causes anxiety in non medical users. Update I contacted Welltory but could get no one medical to explain the significant differences in health data. My replies were from a support engineer with no medical background. They said Welltory uses its own algorithm. I would advise users to be very wary of the accuracy of the data and the related stress levels etc that Welltory links to this.
25 July, 2023 at 12:30 PM
Hi, and thank you for your honest feedback! We're really sorry you feel this way about Welltory. Generally, we advise relying on manual measurements with more than 95% accuracy. We also recommend taking regular morning measurements to train our algorithm. The thing is that, in Welltory, your heart rate variability (HRV) is analyzed by a self-learning algorithm. Its calculations are based on both standard HRV metrics and your data. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll take some time for the algorithm to form your baseline and learn more about your body‚Äôs usual state. To train the algorithm: 1. Take measurements at the same time every morning for a week or two (note that in Welltory, morning measurements are the ones taken between 5.00 AM and 12.00 PM). 2. Take measurements after waking up but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. 3. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). 4. If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. If you have any issues with your measurements, please contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue and tap Upload). This way, our support engineers will check your measurements to rule out possible technical issues and will be happy to advise you. Kindly note that Welltory is not a medical app, and it can't be used for diagnostic purposes or as a substitute for professional medical advice. Also, support engineers in Welltory aren't required to have a medical degree as we provide technical support and answer general questions related to the app's features, including HRV. But we'll be happy to do all we can to help you and will refer your questions to our data scientist. Please contact us again via the app ‚Äî we'll be glad to help you address your questions. We hope to hear from you soon.

Wer kommt halbwegs klar mit seinem Leben und m√∂chte entdecken, dass so ziemlich alles verkehrt l√§uft, der kann sich Wahnsinn gerne reinziehen. Das Ding ist aufdringlich, gibt den ganzen Tag seinen Senf dazu, macht mich kirre und verunsichert mich. Toll, dass es mir dabei hilft, Probleme zu beheben, die ich bis eben nicht hatte. Die zugrunde liegenden Studien sind massiv aussagekr√§ftig. Und au√üer dem zugegebenerma√üen gelungenen Design - zumindest optisch - finde ich das Ding keine Hilfe, sondern schlimmer als ne zickende Schwiegermutter. Braucht echt niemand. Ausprobiert, f√ºr doof befunden und gel√∂scht.

Hello. Our research shows that users typically see substantial lifestyle and well-being improvements after several months of using Welltory. The app's self-training algorithm becomes more effective over time as it collects and analyzes data about your body, activities, and habits, and some features may initially be unavailable but become accessible as more data is gathered. Therefore, in order to best support our users' long-term progress, we have decided to discontinue the monthly plan, and as such, it is no longer available on the App Store. However, we do have a free 5-day trial that starts automatically after you sign up for Welltory, and allows you to try out most of our paid features.

Welltory requires an account to safely store and analyze the data linked from various different sources, including your phone camera, smartwatch, and cardio monitors. This allows us to provide personalized insights and recommendations based on your unique profile. For added privacy, you can sign up using your Apple ID with a hidden email address. However, Welltory wouldn't exist without a dedicated team of scientists, data researchers, and engineers who ensure high-quality analysis and daily app support. Subscriptions allow Welltory to pay them for their hard work. We also offer a free version of the app.

Anxiety
ShellyBelly82068
I paid $100 for the full app and I hate it!! It doesn‚Äôt track my sleep patterns for a full night and it tells me I‚Äôm 97% stressed every day, that my health is 30% I know my body and I know I‚Äôm not 97% stressed every day. Seeing all the red in my app causes me to be more anxious and causes me to stress. My Dr said to get rid of this app bc of its inaccuracy. I want my money back!!

I actually paid for the year subscription but‚Ä¶
Bat Flies at Night
All of a sudden, the last two weeks or so, none of my stats are correct. My stand goal shows 0 for Welltory whereas my Apple Watch shows 14. I‚Äôve done 90-100 minutes of cardio or strength training, standing the whole time and wellstory still has it as 0. Silliness. It also has completely different data than my Oura ring for example. My Oura tells me to cool it that day, and Welltory tells me to go for it!! Do 200 mins of exercise. Like‚Ä¶ ? What is this based off of? The times I‚Äôm feeling calm, Welltory tells me I‚Äôm stressed out and my health is declining. I‚Äôm just aghast. I feel suckered out of my $99 at this point and won‚Äôt be renewing.

Broken

Mine worked fine on my iPhone 14 Pro for a while. Out of nowhere, it started telling me it was having problems taking measurements. I‚Äôve followed all instructions. I‚Äôve used Bluetooth HRM‚Äôs that the dev recommends. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled. Still says bad measurements. Customer service offered zero help. Zero. Very disappointing. I will not be renewing its rather pricey subscription. Thanks for nothing.

Disappointed
Wanderingfeet
For all the hype this app gets I was majorly disappointed in it. 1. The displayed charts are unreadable in detail. Sure they look pretty but the axes and labelling are impossible to read so you have no idea what you‚Äôre actually looking at. 2. Data overload. I wanted to trial this app as it was supposed to be one of the best for HRV. My experience of this is Welltory throws the kitchen sink at you (in premium version) but doesn‚Äôt explain very well why one metric is indicating the complete opposite to another and even conflicts with itself on the two separate displays of the SDNN data from Apple Watch - this is extremely confusing and perhaps is done on purpose to steer you to the gobbledegook it spouts on the other calculated indicators. I have no idea whether I‚Äôm stable or unstable. 3. As someone recovering from long Covid, sensory processing can be difficult. The Welltory screens while they look pretty can be very overstimulating to look at with blobs of bright colour flying in and out of the screen in its main daily chart showing your energy levels. This is not great for someone visually sensitive. Overall I‚Äôm very unimpressed with this pricey app. After the 5 day trial of premium (which actually shut down access after only 4 days. I even got a notification on day 6 morning that ‚Äúmy trial is now over‚Äù trying to upsell me onto premium) I continued to use the free version to evaluate further but quite frankly don‚Äôt find it particularly useful or any better than any other app I‚Äôve tried and in some cases (clarity of display) much much worse. Don‚Äôt waste your money - there are better apps out there for wellness that don‚Äôt look as pretty but actually provide much better and much clearer insight into your health.

Bonjour et merci pour vos commentaires. Nous nous excusons pour tout inconv√©nient. Le fait est que nos recherches indiquent que la plupart des utilisateurs constatent des am√©liorations significatives de leur mode de vie et de leur bien-√™tre quelques mois apr√®s avoir utilis√© notre application. L'algorithme d'auto-entra√Ænement s'am√©liore au fil du temps car il recueille des donn√©es sur votre corps, vos activit√©s et vos habitudes, de sorte que les r√©sultats sont plus efficaces √† long terme. Certaines fonctionnalit√©s peuvent ne pas √™tre disponibles initialement, mais deviennent accessibles √† mesure que l'application collecte plus de donn√©es. Pour mieux servir nos utilisateurs, nous allons supprimer le forfait mensuel, et il n'est plus disponible sur l'App Store.

Hi, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store.

Hi, we're sorry to hear that. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful.

Hallo! Vielen Dank f√ºr Ihr Feedback! Wir freuen uns √ºber Ihre Bewertung. Welltory ist derzeit nicht lokalisiert. Die gesamte App zu √ºbersetzen ist ein Berg an Arbeit, da wir viele Inhalte haben. Wenn wir gen√ºgend Anfragen f√ºr eine √úbersetzung in Ihre Sprache erhalten, werden wir diese auf jeden Fall in unsere Roadmap aufnehmen und m√∂glicherweise √ºbersetzen. Einige der Hilfeartikel haben wir aber bereits ins Deutsche √ºbersetzt. Wenn Sie m√∂chten, senden wir Ihnen diese gerne zu, damit Sie sich in unserer App besser zurechtfinden. Bleiben Sie dran f√ºr weitere Updates!

Hi there! We're sorry to hear about your negative experience with the app! Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after. As per the refund, please send us a bug report with the request for a refund, we will help you from there. To send a bug report from the app, go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload. Thanks!

I like it but doesn‚Äôt seem really accurate
Back-Burner
The app is nicely built and I love how the data are pull shown in the app. However I don‚Äôt know what to think about the accuracy of the data‚Äôs. For example it happened several time I had an extreme bad sleep and I was feeling very bad all day but I literally got the best result and I was according to the app ‚Äúready for challenges‚Äù which was the total opposite.

Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after.

There is no way to reach customer support and service to comment on information as being provided that is either in accurate or not in line with a Persons medical conditions. Although a holy believe in the implementation of HRV and meditation, as well as other stress based activities, I feel there are definitely gaps that are missing here and my importantly, information is not being taken into account in relation to a Persons medical conditions and/or disabilities coupled by the inability to reach the company and simply be sent into a system of faqs and articles that are written by their team is anything but helpful, especially when taking into account the cost of the program itself

Don't buy if you fall outside of "normal" parameters
j3nnyfer13
I have a naturally low resting heart rate and low blood pressure. My heart rate takes a bit to rise as I'm exercising and it's recovery is super efficient. I sleep well and deeply. I have a physically active but not difficult job and little daily stress. However, I love optimizing all that I can about my life, so I bought into the promise WellTory gives that the algorithm will adjust over time to one's parameters and give specific and helpful advice. After nearly four months: it's still telling me I don't sleep well, that I'm exhausted when I know I'm not, that I should exercise like crazy (or not at all) apropos of seemingly nothing. I've been told by customer service that the algorithm is set to "normal" parameters for heart monitoring. Then what use is it to anyone that naturally falls outside these parameters? And what of the promise of individualized data and advice? We only get these if our rhythms are "normal", I suppose. I've requested a pro-rated refund and suggested that the advertising is altered to be factual. We'll see.
01 July, 2023 at 2:33 PM
Hello! We're sorry you feel this way about the app. To train the algorithm for your individual norms we recommend doing manual HRV measurements regularly at least for 2 weeks with Apple Watch and the Breathe app on it or with the phone camera. It's also important to keep the accuracy of your measurements high enough (95% or more) so that the algorithm can take these results into account. To get the most accurate results, please, try the following: Lie down or sit down with your back against the back of the chair. Before taking a measurement, wait for 10‚Äì15 minutes to let your heart rate get back to normal. Try not to move. Any movement affects your heart rate. Don‚Äôt try to control your breathing, intentionally taking deep or even breaths. The way you breathe affects your heart rate, so just breathe naturally. Don‚Äôt talk. Talking changes your breathing rhythm. You can read more about how to take accurate heart rate variability measurements in the Help section of the app. Also, please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after.

Hi there, thank you for the feedback! We understand your point about the price. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app and promos with discounts fairly often; stay tuned for those!

Hi, thanks for the feedback! Registration is needed to process your measurements' results and links this data to the user. You create an account and connect data sources, like other apps and cardio monitors. We interpret your measurement results based on that data from the sources and the data you add manually. But don't worry, your data is completely safe. Also, you have an option to sign up for an account with your Apple ID and hidden email address.

Don‚Äôt waste your money
Listener_Union
This app is junk. Mine randomly stopped taking measurements and told me the camera in my brand new iPhone is low quality and incapable of measuring. It was never accurate with how I‚Äôm feeling thus far but I figured I had to let the algorithm learn a while like it claims. Ultimately I always feel better than it tells me I should. This has been a complete waste of money and I‚Äôd like a refund. P.S. it also interferes with the functionality of your Apple Watch and Health app. Nothing works the same after installation. Buyer beware. This app is garbage. Total waste of money.
26 June, 2023 at 3:45 PM
HI, we're sorry for your negative experience with the app! To get accurate results, you need to stick to several simple rules. It‚Äôs essential because your heart responds to everything: your results can be affected not only by your position during the measurement, but also by the food you‚Äôve eaten, the emotions you‚Äôve experienced, the way you breathe, etc. When you start using Welltory, it‚Äôs also important to train the self-learning algorithm, so that it can form your baseline. Regular morning measurements will do the job. They will help the algorithm understand your usual nervous system‚Äôs state before the effect of a breakfast, cigarette, coffee, or workout. To train the algorithm: Take measurements at the same time every morning during a week or two (note that in Welltory, morning measurements are the ones taken between 5.00 AM and 12.00 PM). Take measurements after waking up, but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. You can use the bathroom or drink some water, too, but then you‚Äôll need to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before taking a measurement. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. When the algorithm forms your baseline, you‚Äôll see the relevant notification in your feed. If you need help with getting better results in accuracy, you can contact us via in-app chat ‚Äî we'll be glad to look into your HRV data more in detail and help you get better quality in your measurements with the camera. As per the refund, it's also required to contact us directly for the refund request. Please send us a bug report from the app: go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload.

26 June, 2023 at 6:12 AM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after. As per the shift work, we have the following time range ‚Äî the morning starts at 5 am and ends at midday, the evening starts at 8 pm, and the night starts at 3 am. So, we recommend taking your morning measurements after 5 am. When you take a measurement, say, at 4 am, it's nighttime for Welltory, and our algorithm considers this as if you're still awake, not already awake. We understand that it might be different for some users and have plans to add a personal customizable schedule at some stage.

Measurements never work
carly ydinann
It takes so long to take a manual heart rate measurement and I‚Äôm always trying to stay perfectly still but it barely ever works. It lets me connect my Garmin forerunner for the measurement but then it doesn‚Äôt actually work (stays at 0%). As this is a big part of the app and it feels unusable to me, I‚Äôve given it a low rating. I mean, it has to work. And if it did, I‚Äôd love it!
26 June, 2023 at 12:40 AM
Hi there, thank you for the feedback! The thing is that you cannot take HRV measurements with a Garmin watch. They can be used for activity tracking, but not for HRV measurements. We have detailed articles in the Help section that explain why. As per the long time to take measurements, it usually takes 3-5 minutes, not longer. If you have low accuracy of the measurements, please read our Help section to learn more about the rules for accurate measurements.

Pros and cons
Dmcamacho13
Like the features but it does a poor job explaining what the various metrics actually mean. For example, some offer percentages and others offer numbers but don‚Äôt explain like what the percentages or numbers actually mean. Also, I only got about halfway through one of the self report tests before giving up and quitting because half the questions made absolutely no sense, so the results would have been worthless anyway. Was definitely a frustrating experience as I‚Äôd have been very interested in the results. Seems like a great concept overall, but seems like you guys might seriously need to recalibrate some components.
26 June, 2023 at 12:31 AM
Hi, thanks a lot for sharing your experience with the app! You can find a question mark near each measurement result that explains the metrics a bit more in detail. Also, you can read more about each metric in the Help section: go to Menu ‚Äî Help ‚Äî search for helpful articles.

Anja135
I have tried many times to buy it. It does not work. I have been in contact with their Supportteam and they keep telling me that I do not have enough coverage and therefore my bank does not allow the transaction to come thru. But it is not the case. I really would like to buy but it never worked. I have purchased many app as via Apple Pay but this one is impossible. If I reached out to them they aske me for all the details and at the end cannot solve. I can go and use other apps but I thought this will happen to other people too so you lose money dear app developers!!! Perhaps somebody can go and test it or offer other purchase options via website like PayPal. I don‚Äôt know. Good luck and all the best.

Big glitches
LBird1
There are so many things I love about this app but the reason it gets 2 stars is because the only way I can get consistent readings is manually through the app. It won‚Äôt sync regularly with HRV data from my Apple Watch. I have multiple friends that I‚Äôve recommended this app to say they have the same problem. The HRV readings from my Apple Watch meet all the requirements for a ‚Äúgood reading‚Äù by having at least 50+ RR values, being done while awake, etc. Today, my feed has nothing in it despite having multiple HRV readings from my Apple Watch. Very frustrating and could be a deal breaker for using this app.

Most annoying app I‚Äôve ever used

I like this app, but the constant marketing notifications are atrocious. Even when you‚Äôve paid for a year, you will still get notifications to upgrade. So, you have to turn notifications off, then what‚Äôs the point?

Don‚Äôt buy this app!

This app is ridiculously expensive and you cannot cancel it. I linked it to my Fitbit but it does not take the Fitbit data into its calculations. So on a day when I walked 12,000 steps, it tells me I walked 2,000 and that I need to walk more! Also gives inaccurate data about stress levels. Look on Reddit -people think they are dying after getting this app. Very misleading and expensive. I would like my money back!!

Hi there. We appreciate your feedback, and we're sorry to hear about the issues you've encountered. ÔªøThe way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. ÔªøHeart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Regarding the Fitbit integration, we apologize for any inconvenience caused. Our team is continuously working to improve and optimize data synchronization with various devices, including Fitbit. If you're experiencing discrepancies in step tracking, we recommend reaching out to our support team directly for personalized assistance. They will be able to investigate the issue further and provide a solution. You can contact us by going to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a Problem within the app.

Good app but‚Ä¶
Shelby0116
I like the app, but it takes the heart rate variability measurements at not the best times. Almost always it does it after I just finished a walk that I recorded or some other form of exercise, or it takes it super early in the morning when I‚Äôm still asleep. Also, the sleep part is not accurate at all. It says I only slept 3 hours last night when I slept 7 hours and 5 minutes. I compare it to my pillow app, and pillow is more accurate for sure.
24 June, 2023 at 7:17 AM
Hi, and thank you for your review. Apple Watch takes automatic heart rate variability (HRV) measurements randomly but under certain conditions ‚Äî only when you're calm and relaxed, not moving and your heart rate isn't too high. But as you rightly said, it can happen not at the right time. That's why our data scientists recommend measuring manually. You can read how here: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4241383. To receive correct sleep reports, please make sure your latest sleep data is in Apple Health in the morning before opening Welltory. If you need help with your sleep data, contact us via the app ‚Äî go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload.

Somewhat promising but lately annoying
ben2009
I started using Welltory in May after an HRV tracking app I‚Äôd used for a couple years suddenly required a subscription to see basic data with no analysis. In that app‚Äôs reviews someone mentioned Welltory as a more insightful alternative for around the same price. I‚Äôve used Welltory for about two months now and it is indeed more insightful, though lately I keep getting push notifications about a 40% off offer for a lifetime subscription. It is ridiculous to abuse push notifications to upsell. The value ad is not urgent and doesn‚Äôt require my attention now, I still have 10 months left on my yearly subscription, yet I seem to get one of these upsell alerts every few days. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to prevent upsell notifications without turning off all alerts, which would make Welltory less useful overall. If I were using the free tier of Welltory, this behavior might seem less hostile since no money would have changed hands. Since I‚Äôm a paying customer, it is at best disrespectful of my time and not in line with the purpose of this application. It isn‚Äôt bad enough yet that I‚Äôll cease using Welltory, but it certainly has stained its reputation for me. I hope the developers take this into account and either stop the upsell notifications or provide an opt-out. I read a few other reviews where Welltory said to opt-out via email, but I don‚Äôt see how that would get back to the app and it‚Äôs notifications.

Wildly divergent results
Darkness 777
I downloaded the Welltory app and was shocked: according to it my stress is off the charts and my health in a precarious state. It didn‚Äôt match the results of a recent checkup, but I was still so alarmed that I downloaded the Elite HRV app and bought a Scosche Rhythm 24 arm monitor to compare readings. According to that my HRV readings are normal. I love the exercise analysis on Welltory, but I can‚Äôt recommend the HRV function ‚Äî it‚Äôs just too inaccurate. My Welltory HRV scores are in the high teens, while the Scosche HRV readings put me in the mid to high 50s.
19 June, 2023 at 7:13 PM
Hi there, thanks for the feedback! The way you feel can be different from your measurement results, and it's okay. Ôªø First, it can be due to low measurement accuracy: for the results to be reliable, measurement quality needs to be at least 95%. Second, the way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why you may sometimes feel energized when in reality you need a break. Or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Let‚Äôs look at some examples and see why your measurement results can differ from the way you feel. And the last, if we talk about differences in HRV results on different devices, then the gold standard for analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) is the Kubios software. It is used for medical purposes. We also use it in our HRV calculations. Our frequency-domain scores (RMSSD, SDNN, AMo, pNN50) completely match the Kubios result. We checked it many times. You can check it yourself: Open the web version of our app Export your RR intervals Download Kubios and run the calculation (guide) Kubios is free for personal purposes. If we compare HRV indicators between apps, then for a correct comparison, it is necessary to use the same RR-intervals, since even measurements taken in parallel by different applications will give different results. In this case, the degree of difference will depend on the calculation algorithms. Different devices and apps pick up the signal differently. If you take measurements by a camera, then it is incorrect to compare the results. You can find out why here. If you still want to compare the results, it is better to use a Bluetooth heart monitor and take measurements of 300 RR intervals, while the spectral parameters (Total Power, LF, HF, VLF) can be compared only in parallel, but not in sequential measurements. Spectral analysis shows in which direction the state of your body is changing at a particular moment. Considering that this state adjusts to events every millisecond, to the extent that it changes on inhalation and exhalation, when food moves through the intestines, etc., then you should not evaluate the general state using the spectral. Spectral analysis is useful for the following categories of users: Those who take measurements strictly at the same time of day and in the same position every day, and assess whether the indicators have dropped. If they have decreased by 2-4 times and stay within these values ‚Äã‚Äãfor more than one morning, then this is a sign of problems. For those who conduct meditation or breathing practices in order to understand that the practice gives exactly the effects that it should, and not vice versa. That is, spectral analysis is like a second snapshot of a state. But the parameters from the main screen (Stress, Productivity, Energy) are more reliable for assessing within the day.

glazkovn
Very well-made app. The interface could be a little less cluttered and all the text and advice generated in the feed could be moved to a separate tab. Still, I find 10 dollars per month to be a very high price. You could make it 5 dollars and probably get more subscriptions. But I would suggest to offer a lifetime purchase for those who do not like subscription models.

All Lies! This is so wrong!

I have been trying to get healthier. This app first caught my attention because of all the claims to fame and awards they say they got. According to this app I should be writing you from the grave. After a few alerts, I decided to buy a pulse o meter to check next to it and night and day! It lies and creates fears but not before you think the full paid version will help you fix and identify issues. I feel like an idiot for buying it and will be seeking a full refund. After reading reviews on Reddit my claims were verified. Do NOT buy this!
19 June, 2023 at 4:02 AM
Hi there! We're sorry about your negative experience with the app. First of all, Welltory measures physiological stress, not psychological. It reflects your body's state, not how you feel. So, it's normal to feel okay but have the measurement show you that your body's in overdrive. The state of our autonomic nervous system, which is what heart rate variability shows, can coincide with your feelings, but it can also contradict them. Over the years, we've heard user stories that state how Welltory helped them get in touch with their bodies and learn to listen to them better, which is fantastic ‚Äî but again, it's not always the case. What we're saying is that having physiological stress doesn't mean feeling bad, at least not all the time. Also, having high stress levels doesn't mean you need to lie down immediately and not do anything for the rest of the day ‚Äî but you need to stay mindful and not push yourself too hard (and avoid tough workouts as well ‚Äî overtraining puts a strain on your nervous system). Second, if you have a lot of night measurements made automatically with your Apple Watch ‚Äî you can ignore them. Sometimes the app filters them out automatically, but sometimes it doesn't. It's common to have lousy measurement results during sleep. It means that your body's recovering. Third, data doesn't lie. If your stress levels are always really bad, your body's experiencing stress and needs to recover. Short-term solutions would be breathing practices and relaxing activities ‚Äî something that would activate your parasympathetic nervous system right there and then. Long-term solutions (which are not always doable) would be nutrition, quality sleep, physical activity, etc. The point of Welltory and these measurements is not to scare you into not doing anything but to give you instruments for self-tracking. You can use this data to see what affects your lifestyle positively and negatively to adjust it and develop healthier habits. It's also normal to have anxiety over bad measurements ‚Äî some people struggle with accepting that 5 hours of sleep really does affect their state. But then again, our belief here is that you can only improve what you can measure. It's one thing to know that you're supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it's a whole other thing to see how your body is doing when it has enough time to recover (you can insert any other activity that might have an impact on your health). If you send us a bug report via the app, we can take a closer look at your data. For that, go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and tap Upload.

05 June, 2023 at 3:21 PM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there.

Not sure what to do with the information
MikeFL52
I had spinal surgery after a fall which left me almost paralyzed and has meant learning how to walk and develop stamina again. I thought this app would help me judge my recovery, but I am not sure what to do with the data when it is constantly telling me I am at 96% stress, 15% energy & 30% health and telling to take things easy. When recovering from life changing events you have to push yourself to get back to where you want to be. This app does not help in that process.
04 June, 2023 at 5:48 PM
Hi there! You can specify your medical conditions in the 'Do you have any health risks?' self-test. To find it, please go to Menu ‚Üí Self-tests. All of them will be taken into account after that. We also recommend completing other health-related self-tests. Please note that Welltory is not a medical app. It is not intended to be utilized for medical purposes and is not intended to substitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. They may impact one another, but they‚Äôre not the same. For example, your body‚Äôs systems may be strained after a workout, while your mood is good. Likewise, a roller coaster ride will likely leave you feeling great, but it will also increase your stress level due to the adrenaline boost. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to keep tabs on physical stress: what you feel may not coincide with what your body is actually experiencing. When you‚Äôre not in touch with your body, you risk overdoing it and may end up with chronic stress or other health problems, such as frequent colds.

Stressful to use stress app
uxrobinson
I think some of the information could be useful. But awful design. Tiny tiny light grey text, big pulsing color graphs. Obviously the app has been designed on a big monitor then scaled down with very little thought to usability. Perhaps the information is useful. But for an app that is supposed to indicate stress levels, it sure does contribute to stress levels too.

Help I‚Äôm Melting
PDQ2AVOID
At least according to this program I‚Äôm always needing to take a break, rest or nap. Seems it has me on every reading with one foot already in the grave. üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è. According to my doctor I‚Äôm not getting enough exercise but if this app is correct then my doctor must be trying to kill me off. Very conflicting, confusing and someone‚Äôs not getting it right.

Hi, and thanks for your review. The feedback you get from the app depends on several factors: 1) time of measurement ‚Äî our metrics usually get worse during the day, while the baseline state can be seen in the morning 10-15 minutes after you wake up, 2) type of measurement ‚Äî it can be automatic or manual, and we recommend relying more on manual measurement results because you can control your measurement conditions, 3) measurement quality (accuracy) ‚Äî it should be above 90% for a result to be reliable. Please read more in our Help article: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4253039

Need easier self checks
Kindle mom
I need to be able to select it to check more often instead of having to hold my finger over the camera which is difficult for someone with disabilities. So close to being a five star but there are days where it literally only checks my levels once and I don‚Äôt understand why some days it does that and other days and checks multiple times. There needs to be a way to alert the app that you have chronic conditions because my app literally is always telling me you must be coming down with something. No I live with multiple somethings and this is my normal unfortunately. Please add the ability to schedule checks instead of having to do manual checks.

Hi, and thank you for your detailed feedback! We'll pass it on to our developers. Please note that automatic (background) Apple Watch measurements are limited by how active you are. Apple Watch takes such measurements only when you're calm and relaxed, not moving, and your heart rate isn't too high. This is the case when you're asleep, but doesn't happen too often during the day. Besides, it might happen when you're calm but talking or doing something without moving much. These are not optimal conditions for heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. That's why our data scientists recommend measuring manually.

Enough With the Upsells
RyanITV
I've been using the app for several months, paying $99 for an annual subscription. Lately, it won't stop asking me to upgrade to a "Lifetime" subscription via notifications, enough so that I simply deleted the app entirely. If I'm paying you guys $100 for the software for a year, it's incredibly annoying to get hounded to pay even more for no change in functionality. You've lost me as a customer.

I like the app and it‚Äôs features but $99 dollars is not an option for me. It says $8.99 but that doesn‚Äôt come up in purchasing only the $99 so that is my only drawback.
01 June, 2023 at 2:17 PM
Hello there, and thanks for your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience. The thing is that our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we're going to remove the monthly plan and it's no longer available on App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose from other plans available there.

28 May, 2023 at 1:36 PM
Hi there. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We usually recommend relying on measurements that are more than 95% accurate. We also recommend taking manual measurements every morning and following a few simple rules: 1. Lie down or sit down with your back against the back of the chair. 2. Before taking a measurement, wait for 10‚Äì15 minutes to let your heart rate get back to normal. 3. Try not to move. Any movement affects your heart rate. 4. Don‚Äôt try to control your breathing, intentionally taking deep or even breaths. The way you breathe affects your heart rate, so just breathe naturally. 5. Don‚Äôt talk. Talking changes your breathing rhythm. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful.

Never again will I try these gimmicks! This app was not clear. You need to purchase many other apps to get the information. I cancelled 10 minutes after looking it over and still charged for the year even though I did the $8 monthly.
27 May, 2023 at 7:32 PM
Hi there. Thank you for your feedback! We show the monthly price so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e., it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. You also confirm the payment amount before purchasing a subscription. To get the information, you just need a smartphone that can be used for HRV tracking in Welltory. We can calculate your baseline based on measurements. You can install other applications as you wish, depending on the type of data you would like to receive from us.

Confusing possibly not calibrated for my health issues
kittenwhisperer
I have been trying several apps to monitor and predict ability to push exercise and recovery. I have always been an active person but due to a Asthma/COPD flare up I have lost a significant amount of cardiovascular endurance. I have tried a few HRM apps and other all inclusive apps. Welltory sometimes didn‚Äôt match other apps. I found while its dashboard is vibrant, it is also hard to read and its messages are contradictory. I often set my body is experiencing high stress and/or low energy and to slow down. But the exercise recommendations tend to recommend increased exercise. I wish the daily feed gave feedback on progress towards the app‚Äôs recommended daily goals of standing, exercise since its measurements are different than Apple‚Äôs health.
26 May, 2023 at 4:13 PM
Hi there, thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you. Sometimes, the way you physically feel may differ from the key insights you get after taking a measurement. And it‚Äôs ok. Many different things can have a bearing on how you feel ‚Äî from events in your life and diseases affecting your hormone and neurotransmitter levels to caffeine, nicotine, and other substances. You may feel energized when your body needs a break. Or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. This is exactly where HRV measurements are helpful ‚Äî they show you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. If we compare HRV indicators between apps, for a correct comparison, it is necessary to use the same RR-intervals, since the degree of difference will depend on the calculation algorithms. We use in our HRV calculations the Kubios software ‚Äî the gold standard for analyzing HRV, i.e. our HRV score is reliable. As per exercise goals (move goals): they are calculated on the number of workouts you do for the last 7 days. So, the more you work out, the higher the goal is. But if you want to check it in detail, please contact us via in-app chat, we'll double-check your calculations.

Measurements review
The app studying
I will give 3 stars on this app and the reason is the it self is good but doesn‚Äôt use Apple Watch to determine when checking for stress or body energy you have to use the phone camera it would better if it detect everything throughout the watch over all I like it just the feature needs more update .
24 May, 2023 at 8:49 PM
Hi there, and thanks for your feedback. If you have an Apple Watch Series 1 or later, your watch can record your HRV data automatically. As soon as it does, we‚Äôll do the math and send the measurement results to your feed. However, note that Apple Watch automatically measures your heart rate variability only when you are calm and relaxed. When you are stressed and your heart is beating too fast, the watch won‚Äôt automatically write your HRV data to Apple Health.

Ron ww
I used this for a couples days as trials and everything are totally inaccurate. Say. I‚Äôm at 5% energy level which not true. I‚Äôm highly energetic person. Said I have high level of stress. Which I don‚Äôt feel any stress‚Ä¶ever. Heart rate is one thing is accurate. That‚Äôs it. But other feature are totally off. To developers; ahh I see what you‚Äôre saying. That‚Äôs interesting how those work. I‚Äôll give it another shot for it. Added 2 more stars for your clarification :)
23 May, 2023 at 6:33 PM
Hello there! Thank you for the feedback; we appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to the any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. UPD: Thanks a lot for updating your review! We're always here to answer all of your questions :)

I wanted to try it out for a few months, but they automatically bill you for a year when you order it and offer various excuses when you try and cancel. I basically paid way too much for an app that does the same thing as Heartwatch and wants to charge a monthly fee for it. It also makes helpful recommendations for meditation and stuff like that, but basically a repeat of the same thing every day and really not worth that amount of money every month. Unfortunately people with health problems are pretty desperate for any help they can get and companies out there like this one that are willing to take advantage.
21 May, 2023 at 4:29 PM
Hello there, and thank you for the feedback. It's appreciated. There is a lot of data measured by Apple Watch in Apple Health. It's an aggregator of data for Welltory ‚Äî it means that we collect all this data from AH, analyze it using our smart algorithms, and provide users with a customized feed of helpful recommendations and insights based on the regular HRV measurements that you do right in the app. Also, the app has a free version that you can use forever and promos with discounts very often, so stay tuned!

solarize00
During the trial, you‚Äôll think the app is alerting you to a change in your stress level but it doesn‚Äôt matter what you‚Äôre doing - they will always say you are stressed regardless of what you‚Äôre doing. Just got up after a good night‚Äôs test? STRESSED. Worked out and feeling great? SUPER STRESSED. Been having a quiet night at home? CODE RED STRESSED AND YOU‚ÄôLL PROBABLY DIE. Some other gems from the app: ‚ÄúYour body‚Äôs stress response systems are going haywire.‚Äù ‚ÄúLooks like a hard day‚Äôs night. You‚Äôre strained and it‚Äôs a bit much for you, though you‚Äôre coping ok.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can pull it together like the superstar you are, but it will be a struggle.‚Äù ‚ÄúMitigate stress, you‚Äôve got plenty.‚Äù ‚ÄúTake things nice and slow, or you might start feeling worse.‚Äù ‚ÄúStrain has you out of the game.‚Äù So if you want to be constantly stressed about your health, this is the app to get! The developers are clueless about how much harm their dramatic and alarmist language could do to people‚Äôs mental health. On top of this, they will keep bombarding you with useless tips like breathe, listen to music, how to get the most out of your workouts, etc. without the app providing an option to silence these notifications. Until they address these main issues, they should offer refunds. A week trial isn‚Äôt long enough to figure out that this is a fear mongering app. ZERO STARS.
19 May, 2023 at 9:14 AM
Hello there! Thank you for your feedback. First of all, we‚Äôre sorry about that. It‚Äôs never our intention to scare you ‚Äî we only want you to pay close attention to what your nervous system is experiencing, as it‚Äôs the key to your wellness. It's normal to have anxiety over bad measurements ‚Äî some people struggle with acknowledging that, for example, 5 hours of sleep really does affect their state. It‚Äôs hard for us to accept that our bodies might be experiencing stress without us knowing. But then again, we believe you can only improve what you can measure. It's one thing to know that you're supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it's a whole other thing to clearly see the data on how your body is doing when it gets enough time to recover. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems.

If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors.

Not very helpful
fyou9009
I‚Äôve used this app for months with a new Apple Watch. I have been hoping that the data it provides improves but it hasn‚Äôt. I get random reports of my heart health, it tells me I am ALWAYS stressed, and the advice is very limited and repetitive. No matter how my day goes, it says I need to relax. Even though I wake up early every day, it says I am not getting enough sleep but then recommends I try to go to sleep much later than I normally do. If this app wasn‚Äôt already paid for, I‚Äôd cancel it. Oh - and the fact it charges you for a year instead of month to month is pretty crappy. Read the agreement carefully if you sign up after the free trial.
18 May, 2023 at 1:52 PM
Hi there, and thanks for your feedback. We're sorry to know you're not satisfied with your experience with the app. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it's a degree of tension in the body's regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, "good" stress level is something in the middle. As for the sleep reports, they are based on an in-depth analysis of your overnight heart rate patterns and historical sleep data, so your sleep analysis is personalized and packed with insights that will steer you toward better recovery.

Hello there, thank you for the feedback. This is actually not true, your HRV results don't depend on the kind of version of the app you have. Also, you don't have to purchase a subscription, you can stay with the free version forever. As per the statement that we steal your data, do you have any evidence of that? This is a crucial topic for us. We value our users' trust. We guarantee that we never disclose, transfer or sell data to a third party. Your data belongs only to you.

Amykay581
No matter what I do it says I‚Äôm stressed and need to relax. Even if I spent the entire day relaxing and reading and doing nothing! According to this I am always stressed. Even when I am not. Feel like this is not accurate at all. I have a heart rate that runs higher then normal. It has since I was a child. However this picks it up and decides I‚Äôm stressed. Took a nap and just woke up, yep stressed. Sat for 3 hours reading a book, yep stressed. It‚Äôs always saying to relax you need a slowdown! I can‚Äôt get much slower then a nap! All this app did was cause stress! I even ended up going to doctor, who said there is nothing wrong with me!
16 May, 2023 at 8:38 PM
Hello, thank you for leaving the feedback! It's appreciated. First of all, we would recommend you make sure you take your measurements correctly. Make sure you follow the measurement rules. For example, you should take a morning measurement 10-15 minutes after you‚Äôve wakened up because your body needs some time to bring all systems into an active state. Second, please make sure the accuracy of your measurements is high enough (95-100%): https://help.welltory.com/articles/3361520-how-to-take-accurate-heart-rate-variability-measurements. Also, please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after.

Had this app for a few months, now‚Ä¶
Markity M
I really want to like this app. And maybe it just isn‚Äôt for me. So, this rating is for me specifically. About me: I‚Äôm 42, I work out (CrossFit, yeah, I‚Äôm one of THOSE people) between 3-5 days a week. The rest of the days I‚Äôm still pretty active. I eat junk food sparingly, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol, I don‚Äôt smoke, I meditate regularly. That being said, for me, it seems a lot of the advice and ‚Äúpop- ups‚Äù for me contradict themselves. It‚Äôll say I‚Äôm not stressed enough, then it will say my blood pressure is too high and that I should consider meditation and/or working out. It will say I‚Äôm not consistent enough with my workouts though I do so regularly. Or it will say I need more cardio, but say a workout ‚Äúdepleted me‚Äù because it was TOO cardio. Dunno, I think some parts of the app don‚Äôt talk to other parts of the app. In any case, as I said, maybe I‚Äôm just not in their demographic. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è feels like I‚Äôm always doing something just a little bit wrong.

Lots of info. Not a lot of help.
ellegypsy
I accidentally bought a year of AI coaching (I thought I was signing up for a free trial. That‚Äôs on me.), but so far the coaching has been less than helpful. The app itself is full of SOO many details. If you‚Äôre working with a dr to get your health on track, this is probably pretty useful. If you don‚Äôt know what is causing you to feel tired, this app has the ability to track relationships between what you do and how you feel (it‚Äôs very involved, however). For all of that, it gets 3 stars. But it stops there. It purports to do much more, and I‚Äôm often getting recommendations to breathe more. However when I‚Äôm feeling happy and relaxed, it is often giving me push notifications that I need to calm down. Looking at my stats of how stressed I apparently constantly am, is constantly stressing me out. And it often (read: daily) tells me I need to ease up and take things more chill, while also telling me I need to burn >700 move calories and have 126 minutes of exercise with my heart rate over 115. These two things do not coexist. By Saturday/Sunday I‚Äôve normally earned a daily goal of zero exercise minutes, but my move goal is still between 700-800kcal. And it‚Äôs still telling me I need to slow my roll‚Ä¶ in all the witty yet totally unhelpful ways that it does. It also differentiates your metrics based on what it‚Äôs seen from you, verses the more generalized metrics. I often will have 9/9 generalized metrics showing as healthy, while my ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù metrics are saying I‚Äôm out of energy and can‚Äôt focus‚Ä¶ Moral of the story: I‚Äôve had this app for a few weeks now, and so far it‚Äôs only caused more stress.

Hello, thank you for leaving the feedback! It's appreciated. First, we are sorry that the app made you feel stressed and that your experience with Welltory wasn't satisfying enough. Second, please make sure you follow the measurement rules. For example, you should take a morning measurement 10-15 minutes after waking up because your body needs some time to bring all systems into an active state. Also, ensure your measurements' accuracy is high enough (95-100%): https://help.welltory.com/articles/3361520-how-to-take-accurate-heart-rate-variability-measurements. Heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after. Also, we'd really like to look into your data deeply to sort everything out, so please contact us via the app. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report.

I love the app through the trial. The. The trial ended and I wanted to move forward into a subscription but the only option is a yearly. It‚Äôs shows a monthly but does not allow you to put it on an actual monthly which is what I prefer. If this could get fix I would immediately subscribe and change rating!!
15 May, 2023 at 1:56 PM
Hello there, and thanks for your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience. The thing is that our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we're going to remove the monthly plan and it's no longer available on App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose from other plans available there.

Good but $$$

I downloaded this a couple of days ago and so far really like it. The only issue I have it is $99 for the year! One payment and no option for monthly payments. I find it difficult to make this much of a commitment when I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll like or even utilize the additional features. I‚Äôll stick with the free option until if/or when they offer a monthly payment option. Update: Thus developer response is a cut and paste response. Developer stated could manage monthly plan in App Store. This is not true. Want people to spend $99‚Äìa personal response would be appreciated.
15 May, 2023 at 5:15 AM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there. UPD: we never said you can manage your monthly subscription in App Store. It's the other way around: monthly subscription has been achieved in the store. We're sorry for the confusion!

Does not work well for active people
Emerald Moon
As a fitness enthusiast I was excited to try this out and bought the annual membership. Unfortunately, day after day, the app told me I was under extreme stress and in danger of falling ill because of my workouts. I researched it and realized the app is better for people who don‚Äôt get much exercise and that regular fitness participants will have results like mine. The company was not willing to refund me the balance of my remaining membership because ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù. Pretty disappointed. It caused more stress than benefits.

Hello there, and thank you for your honest feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. Welltory is useful for everybody, including athletes and people who are managing chronic illnesses and can‚Äôt sustain an active lifestyle. As for your measurements, we recommend you do them not right after a workout ‚Äî any kind of sport is stressful for your body, so you need time to recover. As for your refund request ‚Äî our support team is always ready to help you within our policy.

Ludicrous App
kon098
I downloaded this due to the high ratings given by other users The readings and comments it provides are confusing - and presumably there to worry the user into buying the premium version It only runs off other apps‚Äô collected information and then makes outrageous guesses (most of them incorrect) about your state of health I took two blood pressure readings today- the first was described as ‚Äògreat‚Äô but the second as ‚Äòalarming‚Äô - this despite both being almost the same! Avoid this app - and stick to the free versions in other health apps provided by your watch or phone - this one is a joke!
12 May, 2023 at 10:37 AM
Hi, and thanks for your feedback. We're sorry you didn't find Welltory useful. But you don't have to buy the premium version ‚Äî you can use the free one with limited features. Please note that Welltory doesn't measure blood pressure. Our app takes heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. HRV is an indicator of our autonomic system and is very sensitive to even the slightest changes in influencing factors. Therefore, it's normal that your HRV metric change even within minutes, let alone during the day.

States almost every measure is poor quality. I‚Äôve worked in labs and can follow procedures. If you leave notifications on, it‚Äôs nearly endless pings. It will flat out refuse to measure sometimes. Pointless.
11 May, 2023 at 2:06 PM
Hello! It's important to follow the recommendations on how to measure correctly because heart rate variability (HRV) is very sensitive to even the slightest changes in all the factors influencing our body. To see your body baseline state, we recommend taking measurements at the same time every morning. This will both show you how your body is doing before the effect of a breakfast, cigarette, coffee, or workout, and will help our algorithm interpret your other measurements. Take measurements after waking up, but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. You can use the bathroom or drink some water, too, but then you‚Äôll need to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before taking a measurement. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. To check your measurement‚Äôs accuracy, tap the liquid message opening the detailed information ‚Äî the accuracy score will be under the key insights. You can turn off the notifications for Welltory in your iPhone settings.

This (extremely expensive) app suggests there‚Äôs a monthly option HOWEVER to proceed past this point will instantly charge you $159.99 WITHOUT any chance of a refund (I tried via the App Store, and also tried via the Apple App Store review decision option). Functionally, it also seems a little glitchy and not exactly 'live and real time' - not bad for keeping you mindful of your well-being BUT NOT worth $159.99. BE WARNED!!!
10 May, 2023 at 2:56 AM
Hello! We're truly sorry about your negative experience with the app. Currently, we don't have monthly subscriptions in App Store. We show the monthly price so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e. it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. We do not provide such discounts for a monthly subscription. As per the refund, if your subscription is purchased with App Store, to request a refund, please contact Apple as according to Apple's policies, all operations related to products purchased in App Store are processed only on Apple's side. You can find details on how to request a refund in the article that we sent you in the chat. To facilitate the process, we recommend contacting Apple Support by phone.

Disappointed
Cre8tv
I purchased a Pro subscription, but it‚Äôs been quite a disappointment. For this high price, I would expect the advertised features to be working, and they aren‚Äôt. A major issue is that MyPlaces (the app‚Äôs own geotracking) is not functional. It worked for a day or two, but even then, it was sorely lacking in detail. For example, though I have precise tracking turned on, Welltory gave me a general ‚Äúentering [county name].‚Äù That is basically useless. Support has been slow to nonexistent and has had me follow a procedure involving disconnecting MyPlaces, deleting the app, rebooting, reinstalling the app, reconnecting MyPlaces, all for it to still not work. I‚Äôm waiting on a support ticket. I‚Äôm talking with other users, they report the same issues of MyPlaces not working. This aspect of the app was a big reason I paid for Pro, so this is completely unacceptable. Other disappointments: ‚ÄîIf MyPlaces will ever work, research has shown that based on patterns of your day, the app will ASSUME you‚Äôre at work, and if you‚Äôre not, there‚Äôs no way to change that. ‚ÄîTagging issues. There are tags that Welltory has created, and there‚Äôs no way to delete them. For example, I don‚Äôt want a tag for ‚Äúchildren‚Äù or ‚ÄúPMS,‚Äù but I‚Äôm stuck with them. Additionally, if you create a new tag that accidentally duplicates a tag that Welltory has, you can‚Äôt delete it. Therefore, I‚Äôm stuck with a tag named ‚Äúnap(2).‚Äù You also cannot recategorize a tag into a different category like Health after you‚Äôve placed it in a category. For this subscription price, I would expect to be able to customize things much more. ‚ÄîExcessively alarmist language. Every day I‚Äôm in the red. The app calculates HRV differently than the Apple Watch does. And every day, it has this red, what they call ‚Äúliquid‚Äù that looks like lava sloshing and spitting up embers, with stupid messages like, ‚ÄúCheck It Before You Wreck It.‚Äù It goes on to tell me I‚Äôm incredibly stressed out, my energy is just about nonexistent, and that my health is vulnerable. Yes, you can supposedly train the app to adjust to your own baseline over time, but this is a long process, and you just might become so discouraged and demotivated before then that you don‚Äôt keep using it. If I were to take these messages seriously, I‚Äôd spend all day in bed meditating and never exercise or do anything to improve health. This aspect has had a negative effect on my mental health. When I check with other users on social media groups, they have similar complaints and say they just don‚Äôt pay attention to the hysterics from Welltory. Well, that‚Äôs a fail. You subscribe to the app because you expect you‚Äôll want to pay attention to it. ‚ÄîStupid, irrelevant filler content. Welltory regularly serves up such content as letting me know the fact that I can pinch my elbow as hard as possible without feeling pain. Gee, life-changing, helpful, usable stuff there. I really want to like this app. If MyPlaces were functional and more specific, that would help, but it‚Äôs completely nonfunctional at this point‚Äîthis despite the app supposedly did an update four days ago. Why are they advertising this feature then if it‚Äôs not working? When you pay for a subscription, especially one as expensive as this is, you expect to get what is advertised. In social groups about the app, I cannot find a SINGLE person who has MyPlaces working. Also, for the cost of the Pro version, I expect more customization ability. I should be able to create, edit, and delete tags. I should be able to opt out of their silly, irrelevant filler content. Basically, this should be a tool that I can customize rather than be locked into their inadequate user interface. Fix these things, and I‚Äôll raise my rating and probably evangelize the app so much that you‚Äôll have several new users. Til then, I would not recommend the Pro version to anyone.
08 May, 2023 at 6:36 PM
Hello, thank you for taking time to write such a detailed review with your feedback about your experience with the app. First of all, we're sorry about your disappointment. We've answered you in the chat about the MyPlaces feature, please check the new messages from us. As per the tags, right now it's not possible to delete the tags indeed, but thank you for the idea, we will make sure to forward your feedback to the team! The app cannot calculate HRV differently than the Apple Watch does, because we use Apple Watch for measurements and we take data from Apple Health. Also, we measure physical rather than emotional stress. They may impact one another, but they‚Äôre not the same. For example, your body‚Äôs systems may be strained after a workout, while your mood is good. Likewise, a roller coaster ride will likely leave you feeling great, but it will also increase your stress level due to the adrenaline boost. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to keep tabs on physical stress: what you feel may not coincide with what your body is actually experiencing. When you‚Äôre not in touch with your body, you risk overdoing it and may end up with chronic stress or other health problems, such as frequent colds. Thank you for all your feedback, we're forwarding it to the team.

iOS app underperforms VS Android
summersara365
I‚Äôm disappointed that I paid for this app for Apple devices. It doesn‚Äôt update frequently enough throughout the day for data from my Apple Watch to be helpful and you can‚Äôt update it on demand from the Apple Watch interface like you can from a Samsung watch. My SO has an android phone and a Samsung watch that is used with this app. It‚Äôs easy to get feedback on demand as well as very frequent updates without updating yourself on the android version. Overall if you have android, I think the performance is much more optimized and you can get a ton of great info. If you have iOS, there are much better apps so I wouldnt go this route. Oh! And the android subscription costs less too!! How absurd is it that I paid more for less consistent or convenient data updates than I would get if I had an android???!!!???

Bonjour, je regrette d‚Äôavoir install√© cette application, je pensais am√©liorer celle d‚Äôorigine, mais elle e √©cras√© mes donn√©es et en plus elle est en anglais. Je ne comprends que le fran√ßais. J‚Äôavais un suivi de poids, et de donn√©es cardiaque suite √† mes soucis de sant√©. Plus rien ! Comprends plus rien ! Merci de fais une traduction en fran√ßais que nous puissions se servir de votre application

Paid for upgrade but nothings changed
kirk025
Hey y‚Äôall, I know something funky must have happened but y‚Äôall had a 35% off deal and I went to pay from Apple Pay. Purchase was confirmed and shows in my bank account but in the app it doesn‚Äôt show that I‚Äôve upgraded. And when I try to ‚Äúrestore purchases‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt work. And then I hit ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù and it brings me back to another screen that asks for the full amount instead of 35% off. Is there a way y‚Äôall can fix this? üò¨

App built for couch potatoes, not athletes
ChrisP98
This app is not only poorly designed and difficult to navigate. It is also seems designed for uneducated couch potatoes. The advice given is generic. I was hoping for more, given the price.

28 April, 2023 at 6:22 PM
Hi there, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Additionally, some features only become available after you've been using the app for a while, and it has enough data to provide you with personalized insights. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store.

A con job
jobear1356
First off , there is no trial period and they charge 99$ for a year for the app which is way too much for what it does which is nothing. It doesn‚Äôt come up with new data, it only repeats what it gets from apple in a very confusing form. It also keeps repeating the same inaccurate data. I will write this off as a bad waste of time and money.
28 April, 2023 at 4:00 AM
Hi there. We have a 5-day free trial with some of the PRO features, which starts automatically when you sign up for Welltory, i.e. you don't have to subscribe for it. During the first five days, you get full details for your measurements and blood pressure readings. After that, you also can take measurements for free forever, but only with a limited description. Welltory does not repeat what it gets from Apple Health, Welltory interprets people‚Äôs data into insights and guidance to help them be healthier, happier, and more productive. It‚Äôs like a personal health coach who tells you what your data means and what you can do to feel better.

Wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased
heocps
Before paying for the app, I wish I had waited until it offered my fitness activities. I have to go back and forth between this app and the Apple Fitness tracker that offers activities that Welltory omits. Then, to add further frustration, if I have used the fitness tracker in Welltory for an activity and then later try to go back and use the Apple Watch tracker, it doesn‚Äôt register my heart rate. I requested that tennis be added a couple of weeks ago, but, despite a message that my request would be passed along, nothing happened. I wish I had stayed with the free app.

Impractical and negative recommendations
rmsumm
The 2 stars allocated are for the interesting data and potential this app has but, it needs work. First, many of the readings (about 50%) are low quality even though I do the reading the exact same way each time. So the data cannot be input. More importantly, the recommendations and feedback are not realistic and frankly negative. So negative and impractical, they could affect my positive mood and made me question if I was really feeling as great as I thought. If the numbers indicated anything negative, the recommendations are to rest all day, do self care, and not make any important decisions. Who can do that? I'm a professional who works full time and a mom raising children. I never rest all day and I don't have the ability to not make decisions. Perhaps this app is good for a person without a lot of responsibilities and the only focus is on self preservation. But from a practical, realistic point of view - the app is not relevant to my busy, active lifestyle.
24 April, 2023 at 1:21 PM
Hello there! Thank you for sharing feedback! The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, a ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet ‚Äî most often it‚Äôs either overworking or working out too much. Hope you will find this information helpful!

Hello there, and thanks for your feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience. The thing is that our research indicates that most users experience significant improvements in their lifestyle and well-being within several months of using our app. The self-training algorithm improves over time as it gathers data about your body, activities, and habits, so the results are more effective in the long term. Some features may not be available initially but become accessible as the app collects more data. To better serve our users, we're going to remove the monthly plan and it's no longer available on App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose from other plans available there.

If you like the idea of having an app that constantly tells you all day every day "You need to relax more!" "Take a break!" "Refuse an intense pace!" "Take it easy!" Then this is the app for you!!!
22 April, 2023 at 1:29 AM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. We're sorry you had a negative experience with the app. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. We measure physical rather than emotional stress. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after.

Informative app but slow to update. I have it synced with my Apple Watch, It‚Äôs 8:15am, I‚Äôve been awake for 2 hours and it has only just updated my readings from yesterday‚Äôs reading at 4:39pm. I get at most 3 updates a day. I‚Äôve looked in settings for both watch and phone and can‚Äôt see where I can increase the number updates per day. Is this as good as it gets for an app I paid $300 for?

A negative and non-helpful experience
m_wand
I am an active and gym going guy. I decided to download and try this app to provide more insight on workouts vs the fitness app on the phone. I‚Äôll get to the point- the app consistently provided negative feedback on literally everything I did or didn‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs not helpful for an app to tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre stressed out‚Äù or ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt feeling well‚Äù or anything like it when I am feeling great and doing very well. Even on a rest day it continued to speak negative things to me. Even if the app were trying to provide helpful info and insight, actually TELLING a user how they feel is 100% not helping anything. I deleted the app after a week of it telling me how badly I‚Äôm feeling and raining negative energy on me daily. My advice to the designers of the app‚Ä¶ fix the language and user experience to not berate and degrade users. I understand you were shooting for an intimate and personalized experience, but you‚Äôve overshot and landed in an obtrusive area. My advice to potential users of the app‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt download or use this app. Find an app that provides data in a nice package and doesn‚Äôt try to dictate how you feel.

I think it a great app, with overall great potential, but I received 7 consecutive notifications the moment I woke up and stepped away from my bed.

Hi, and thank you for your review! We're sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your experience using Welltory. We totally understand some solutions can cause different feelings. That's why we are constantly collecting our users' feedback ‚Äî not only to add new features, but also to make the app more intuitive and easier to use. As for the price, Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap.

Complete waste of money
coquitolun
All it told me is how stressed I was all the time. Even when I was resting. Even when there was no stress in my life. It didn‚Äôt measure anything accurately. I wish I could get my money back.
13 April, 2023 at 9:02 PM
HI, and thank you for the review. Please note that the results might show such results dues to various reasons. For example, you only use automatic Apple Watch measurements, or you take measurements only during the day after multiple factors influenced your body, while to see your baseline state, it's important to measure in the morning, or your measurement quality (accuracy) is below recommended 95%, which invalidates the results. Heart rate variability (HRV) is very sensitive even to the slightest changes in both external and internal factors. It doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is really experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful.

It could be great, but sadly isn‚Äôt.

I really loved the idea of this app, and I think it could be amazing‚Ä¶if it worked properly. I have heard it works well with the Apple Watch, but the iPhone camera measurement is unbelievably frustrating and finicky, and more often then not will say it can‚Äôt give a reading because you‚Äôre ‚Äúmoving or talking‚Äù, when I haven‚Äôt done either. I will be as still as I can be, covering the camera and flash completely, laying flat, correct finger pressure and room lighting, trying all the tips it tells you, and it still does not work most of the time, saying either I‚Äôm pressing too hard and then not pressing hard enough when I haven‚Äôt moved at all. Because of this, I question the accuracy of the few readings that did come up. I gave it a couple months before writing this, and I want it to succeed and be awesome, but it‚Äôs not quite there yet.
12 April, 2023 at 10:59 PM
Hello there. Thank you for your feedback! Usually, accurate measurements can be taken with the iPhone camera. If you have issues with the accuracy, please, contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem). Our support engineers will check your measurements and will be happy to advise you.

The app looks good but the trial ended in just one day. I would like to try more days but it just said trial ended. Now I‚Äôm try to buy monthly but it looks only offering yearly. Of course I will not spend that kind of money after only one use of the app. I would like to buy monthly but Maine the developer not offering monthly because the app at the end is garbage and every body will end returning or cancelling after the firs month . Uninstalled for now . I‚Äôm thinking developer is not honest offering only yearly
12 April, 2023 at 1:58 AM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there. As per the trial, we have a 5-day free trial with some of the PRO features, which starts automatically when you sign up for Welltory.

Heart Rate Zones Wrong
lxa1132
This app is interesting with all the various data you can see and track but the heart rate zones for workouts are completely useless - they will not let you adjust for your real max HR, only using the calculation which is not accurate for everyone. That renders this portion of the app useless to me - thus to star deduction. Please fix this Welltory!

Hallo zusammen und danke f√ºr das Feedback. Wir entschuldigen uns f√ºr etwaige Unannehmlichkeiten, die durch diese Situation entstanden sind. Unsere Forschung zeigt, dass unsere App bei den meisten Benutzern hilft, innerhalb weniger Monate signifikante positive Ver√§nderungen in ihrem Lebensstil und Wohlbefinden zu erreichen. Unsere App ist langfristig effektiver, da der Selbsttrainingsalgorithmus Sie kennenlernen muss und es Zeit und Daten √ºber Ihren K√∂rperzustand, Ihre Aktivit√§ten, Gewohnheiten usw. ben√∂tigt, um Baselines zu bilden. Dar√ºber hinaus werden einige Funktionen erst sp√§ter auf Ihrer Reise mit unserer App verf√ºgbar, wenn gen√ºgend Daten vorhanden sind, um Ihnen interessante Erkenntnisse zu liefern (z. B. personalisierte Forschung, die zeigt, wie sich zwei Datens√§tze gegenseitig beeinflussen, basierend auf Ihren individuellen Gesundheits- und Wellnessdaten aus der Quellen, die Sie mit der App verbunden haben). Deshalb werden wir den Monatsplan nach und nach von allen Plattformen entfernen und haben ihn bereits im App Store archiviert. Wenn Sie Ihre Abonnements lieber √ºber den App Store verwalten m√∂chten, k√∂nnen Sie andere dort verf√ºgbare Pl√§ne ausw√§hlen.

stress measurements are all over the place
BcycleRepairMan
Morning (7.32am): stress level 95% (I was fast asleep at the time) Noon (12.40pm): stress level 25% (fairly relaxed, vacationing with my kids). I really don‚Äôt get how this can be scientifically proven -I wasn‚Äôt stressed out when I woke up around 8am, and I wasn‚Äôt stressed out at noon -yet the measurements are in opposite ends of the spectrum. Other than that, I like the insights and all the other parts of the app. Would be nice if I could shut off the seemingly randomized stress measurements though.

Feels like like there‚Äôs an agenda
DLZ36
I love health data tracking apps! I had had this app for approximately a month and was enjoying it. I almost purchased the annual membership at 50 percent off since I had waited they keep sending you better deals. Then the article about Vitamin C basically being useless. Then when I was using the HRV measurement within the app, it gives you information to read while recording, which I typically find informative. But again with Vitamin C being useless and risk of vaccine injury is very rare. It said risk of drowning in bathtub was higher than risk of vaccine injury. That is offensive to lots of people at this point and not accurate. You can pick and choose which study you want to support your agenda. Made me think app creators work for pharmaceutical company. Deleted app, and glad I didn‚Äôt spend the money.

The app said I could pay either 8.33 a month or $100 a year. So I went to buy it but there was no option for the 8.33 a month. Only the $100 a year. I can‚Äôt afford the entire $100 for the year. I am rather angry at the blatant lie. So I will not be using this app. I don‚Äôt use apps that are dishonest. If they can‚Äôt even be accurate about their pricing then I doubt their health data will be very accurate either.

Varies wildly!
Bevboo22
I downloaded the app to give myself a free trial however I‚Äôm not sure of the validity of the results. One minute it says I‚Äôm highly stressed and have no energy and I take another reading five minutes later and it tells me I‚Äôve got lots of energy and no stress, it doesn‚Äôt seem to correlate with how I‚Äôm feeling and it varies so wildly with every reading that I can‚Äôt believe that it is correct, which is a shame as I really like the concept!
01 April, 2023 at 1:12 PM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements. You can read more about it in the Help section or here: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/4253039.

I am sad to report that this app is useless to me. It always reports high stress, even if I‚Äôm napping or meditating so there‚Äôs nothing I can do to change the ratings. What uses that? Furthermore, the graphs use light gray on black, which is impossible for me to read. I put in a request for a change in the answer was we can‚Äôt change that. Wow. Really? It‚Äôs also full of cute phrases that are actually annoying and almost offensive. Hey hey, you hit the hay. No grog slept like a log. It‚Äôs stupid kind of. for 90 bucks a year it‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs got lots of colors and graphs and stuff, so I thought it would be meaningful. But I think they just know how to collect data and they don‚Äôt really know what to do with it.
29 March, 2023 at 3:25 PM
Hello there! Thank you for providing your honest feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. In Welltory, your HRV is analyzed by a self-learning algorithm. Its calculations are based on both standard heart rate variability metrics and your individual data. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll take some time for the algorithm to form your baseline and learn more about your body‚Äôs usual state. Your algorithm may be not trained enough. To train it: 1. Take measurements at the same time every morning during a week or two (note that in Welltory, morning measurements are the ones taken between 5.00 AM and 12.00 PM). 2. Take measurements after waking up, but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. You can use the bathroom or drink some water, too, but then you‚Äôll need to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before taking a measurement. 3. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). 4. If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. When the algorithm forms your baseline, you‚Äôll see the relevant notification in your feed. hat helps. If you have any more feedback or questions, feel free to contact us via the app. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report.

Overpriced and alarming
Mj is gone
This app has makes cool use of data but it is alarming rather than motivating in its design. Half the time, the app makes you feel like you are near death. Way overpriced for what you get and not convinced it‚Äôs all that accurate.
27 March, 2023 at 3:18 AM
Hello there! Thank you for your honest feedback. We've passed it on to our team. Welltory measures physiological stress, not psychological. It reflects your body‚Äôs state, not how you feel. So, it‚Äôs normal to feel okay but have the measurement show you that your body‚Äôs in overdrive. The state of our autonomic nervous system, which is what heart rate variability shows, can coincide with your feelings, but it can also contradict them. Over the years, we‚Äôve heard user stories that state how Welltory helped them get in touch with their bodies and learn to listen to them better, which is fantastic ‚Äî but again, it‚Äôs not always the case. What we‚Äôre saying is that having physiological stress doesn‚Äôt mean feeling bad, at least not all the time. Also, having high stress levels doesn‚Äôt mean you need to lie down immediately and not do anything for the rest of the day ‚Äî but you need to stay mindful and not push yourself too hard (and avoid tough workouts as well ‚Äî overtraining puts a strain on your nervous system). If your stress levels are always really bad, your body‚Äôs experiencing stress and needs to recover. Short-term solutions would be breathing practices and relaxing activities ‚Äî something that would activate your parasympathetic nervous system right there and then. Long-term solutions (which are not always doable) would be nutrition, quality sleep, physical activity, etc. The point of Welltory and these measurements is not to scare you into not doing anything but to give you instruments for self-tracking. You can use this data to see what affects your lifestyle positively and negatively to adjust it and develop healthier habits. It‚Äôs also normal to have anxiety over bad measurements ‚Äî some people struggle with accepting that 5 hours of sleep really does affect their state. But then again, our belief here is that you can only improve what you can measure. It‚Äôs one thing to know that you‚Äôre supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it‚Äôs a whole other thing to see how your body is doing when it has enough time to recover (you can insert any other activity that might have an impact on your health).

I used the app for a long time just for free. But it is not in Dutchü§î but it give me a hope information and useful! When it is more available in other languages I think it would be more successful.. My english is good but for the many difficult words I use translate.

Charged me for a year when I only wanted to try it for a month.
Missykb42
The app is purposely misleading on the cost. Says 99.99/year or 8.33/month and then goes on to talk about how you have the right to cancel as long as it‚Äôs within a day before the monthly subscription renews. But it will still charge you for a full year. I wanted to try this app for a month before purchasing a year subscription and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to contact anyone with Welltory. Be aware.

$100 annual sub only? During a recession ?
Slyiswindledthefbi
I never write reviews but I had to this time. I‚Äôve been using the app for a couple days and I‚Äôm trying to get the hang of it. There‚Äôs a lot to learn certainly, and I think I could really benefit from the app and the data it gathers and presents. I went to purchase and couldn‚Äôt believe the one option presented. Annual subscription is the only option? That‚Äôs $100‚Ä¶ come on. We‚Äôre in a recession. Periodt. Nearly every day a new major corp announces lay offs of 10k, 5k, 7k‚Ä¶ Developer should really consider a monthly subscription or at *least* quarterly.
24 March, 2023 at 8:44 PM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there.

Good app but measurements a problem
red moomin
I constantly get poor measurements, maybe something to do with the camera placement on the iPhone 12? The app is good with interesting information. I‚Äôm not sure how accurate the energy reading is either, it always tells me I‚Äôm completely knackered. Sometimes I feel ok.
23 March, 2023 at 10:59 PM
Hello, thank you for your feedback! First, we recommend you switch to the Ultra Wide camera to improve the quality of your measurements. ÔªøTo change the camera, please open the app Settings ‚Üí Measurement Device and select Ultra Wide camera under the Phone camera section. Then try to take a measurement using the Ultra Wide camera. Also, please try to experiment with your finger positions and the pressure. Here are some tips: 1. Try to cover the phone camera with your fingertip and the flashlight with the finger itself, or conversely, try to cover the phone camera with your finger itself and the flashlight with the fingertip. 2. Try pressing your finger lightly, a little harder, or not pressing at all. 3. Try to hold your palm up with the phone on it, or try to put the phone face down on a table and put your finger on top. If you still have issues with the measurements ‚Äî please, contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem. Briefly describe your issue and tap Upload). We‚Äôll check your measurements and will be happy to help.

Stressed me out MORE WAY MORE!
tnjwilhite
OMG..I am 55 and a woman. You would have thought I was going to have a heart attack every day! I daily 95 to 98 % stressed! It told me daily not to make any decisions! On gees I have a household to run, work and family! Every time I looked at this app, my I watch would tell me my rate was high! No thank you to an app that makes me more stressed out! I am in good physical, mental and medical shape. I am not over weight! I was just wanting to keep myself that way! Not with this app! No thank you!
21 March, 2023 at 3:20 PM
Hello there, and thanks a lot for your feedback. We're sorry that the app made you feel this way. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it's ok. Heart rate variability doesn't reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what's happening to you. Many things can affect your state, from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That's why sometimes you may feel energized when you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That's when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is experiencing. Also, high stress is not necessarily bad, and low stress is not necessarily good; it's a degree of tension in the body's regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, a "good" stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can't respond adequately to any threats or stress factors you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress and didn't recover yet - most often, it's either overworking or working out too much. The point of Welltory and these measurements is not to scare you into not doing anything but to give you instruments for self-tracking. You can use this data to see what affects your lifestyle positively and negatively to adjust it and develop healthier habits. It's also normal to have anxiety over bad measurements ‚Äî some people struggle with accepting that 5 hours of sleep does affect their state. But then again, our belief here is that you can only improve what you can measure. It's one thing to know that you're supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it's a whole other thing to see how your body is doing when it has enough time to recover (you can insert any other activity that might have an impact on your health). Hope you will find this information helpful. Please contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem) or at support@welltory.com, and we'll take a closer look at your data. Hope to hear from you soon.

The app itself is ok, but it‚Äôs noisy!
Niclas28
I put off writing this review until I was using it for months, I paid for the full app so I wanted to give it a good try. The app is good, detailed info, everything that you need to know. The watch and phone are fairly accurate.. Perfect! But straight away I noticed the phone stays silent until you pick it up‚Ä¶ then you get hammered with notifications. Some notifications are back to back, others are 10/20 sec apart.. so if you unlock your phone to do anything you spend the first minute or so opening the app unexpectedly because your thumbs accidentally hit the notification, then you close the app and go back to what you were doing for it to keep repeating. Other times you are continuously swiping the notification away‚Ä¶and this goes on and on. I do not get the luxury of browsing through my phone throughout the day. When I unlock it, it‚Äôs for a reason and I need that reason to be quick, It‚Äôs embarrassing when you are with people and they are waiting on your direction and you are busy looking at your heart rate lol I know I will end up turning the notifications off but then paying for the full app will be a complete waste of time and money as I will forget about the app and it‚Äôll just be another unused app. Surely there is a way to merge all notifications into one notification in the morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening, ‚Äúgood morning, check out your results from last night‚Äù or ‚Äúgood evening, look at how your day is going‚Äù. I live in hope that the makers take this on board before it turns into a silent, unused app.
19 March, 2023 at 1:07 PM
Hi there! Thanks a lot for your review. With iOS 15 or later, you can schedule your notification summary daily to catch up at a convenient time. In a personalized summary, alerts are sorted by priority based on app usage, with the most recent alerts displayed at the top. To schedule a notification summary: 1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Scheduled Summary, and then turn on Scheduled Summary. 2. In the Summary section, select the apps you want to include in your notifications summary. 3. In the Schedule section, click the Add button to add a schedule or the Remove button to remove a schedule. Then set the time for each configured schedule summary. To add the Welltory app to an existing dashboard, go back to Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Scheduled Summary and select Welltory in Apps in Summary. Hope that helps! Feel free to contact us if you have any other questions about the app :)

Could be useful but, they've placed too much fluff in the useful items...creepy graphics mixed with very beautiful graphics. Useful technical insight mixed with irritating-over mothering phych-pomp. Not worth the trouble in separating the gold from the gravel.

Hi there, thank you for your feedback and the review.

Hi there, and thanks for your review. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused. Our app has proven to positively impact users' lifestyles and well-being after several months of use. The self-training algorithm needs time to get to know you, and the more data it has about your body's state, activities, and habits, the more effective it becomes. Additionally, some features only become available after you've been using the app for a while, and it has enough data to provide you with some personalized insights. Some features may not be available initially, but become accessible as the app collects more data, offering personalized insights. That's why we decided to gradually remove the monthly plan from all the platforms, and it has already been archived in App Store.

Messung funktioniert nicht richtig
Mr. Schnabelschmidt
An sich eine gute App. Leider funktioniert die Messung mit der Kamera nicht richtig, egal wie ich meinen Finger positioniere. Schade, da so meine Werte nicht stimmen bzw. gar nicht angezeigt werden. Ich hoffe das wird verbessert / behoben!
10 March, 2023 at 12:06 PM
Hallo! Danke f√ºr Ihre R√ºckmeldung. Bitte versuchen Sie, mit Ihren Fingerpositionen und dem Druck zu experimentieren. Hier sind einige Tipps: Versuchen Sie, die Telefonkamera mit Ihrer Fingerspitze und die Taschenlampe mit dem Finger selbst abzudecken, oder versuchen Sie umgekehrt, die Telefonkamera mit Ihrem Finger selbst und die Taschenlampe mit der Fingerspitze abzudecken. Versuchen Sie, Ihren Finger leicht, etwas fester oder gar nicht zu dr√ºcken. Versuchen Sie, Ihre Handfl√§che mit dem Telefon darauf zu halten, oder versuchen Sie, das Telefon mit der Vorderseite nach unten auf einen Tisch zu legen und Ihren Finger darauf zu legen. Leider gibt es keine universelle Methode, daher wird es einige Zeit dauern, bis es richtig ist. Bitte probieren Sie verschiedene Optionen aus und √ºberwachen Sie die Messgenauigkeit ‚Äì dies hilft Ihnen, die optimale Position zu finden. Au√üerdem haben wir hilfreiche Artikel im Hilfebereich der App, dort finden Sie hilfreiche Anweisungen.

Hi there. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. Making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap.

I‚Äôm 23 years old and in great health, I feel like this app tries to scare its users into checking it constantly with its unreliable results.
10 March, 2023 at 3:43 AM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. It's fine to have different results of the measurements. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements. You can read more about back-to-back measurements in the Help section of the app: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/4253039.

Read the non-existent small print
Nyah456
I started off, loving this app. It gave me a lot of data that I was looking for to help me improve my mental health, my lifestyle, my fitness, and it was great. Then I chose to change my subscription and I just bought it for the year again because I thought this out was so great and my sleep analytics stopped working the way that they should. In my conversations with ‚ÄúSupport ‚ÄúI am being told that in order for my sleep analysis to continue working I must first open up my Apple health app first thing in the morning, synchronize that data and only after I manually synch my Apple health data, can I open up Welltory to get the proper sleep analysis that I was getting before. I thought the whole point of purchasing and having an app is that I can use it at any point in time in order to get what I need from it, but if I have to manually force synchronization each and every time prior to opening the app in order for it to work in the way that I am expecting, and the way that I paid for, that‚Äôs a problem for me. Life happens and things change, and I may not be able to remember each morning to manually synch my Apple health data, which this app should be doing in the background anyway, since it has access to all of my Apple health data automatically, and only then opening my app to get sleep analysis. But even with following all these manual steps for synchronization, I STILL don‚Äôt get the full sleep analysis consistently throughout my week. I have support specifying that I am the one who has to manually force the Apple sync each and every morning before I can utilize the application I paid for.

Hello there, and thank you for your feedback. We‚Äôre sorry for this negative experience. Let us explain why we suggested you try to sync the data manually. Sometimes when our users experience issues with data synchronization, we first advise them to try syncing data manually in order to exclude other issues. If our standard tips don't work ‚Äî we pass the details of your case on to the tech team so they can look into the issue and help you. If you have any questions, please contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem). Our support engineers will be happy to help.

I‚Äôm not impressed with the insights or the interface‚Ä¶ it feels like an unfinished product and it‚Äôs a bit clumsy to use. A few issues: 1. There isn‚Äôt enough guidance as to how to leverage information the app gives you 2. It doesn‚Äôt take consistent readings with Apple Watch 3. The interface is not clear and the feed is random and chaotic. Overall, I‚Äôm glad I only bought a one month subscription to try it out and I won‚Äôt be renewing, though, I was initially really interested in the product and the insights the advertising promised. It fell short of expectations.

Edit: Since I got a response I‚Äôll say this. While it may not do psychological stress, how is my body always in a state of stress when I‚Äôm at work walking all day? Isn‚Äôt that healthy? I work out, i do martial arts‚Ä¶ so should i just always be laying down and sleeping ? It‚Äôs impossible. I have even trusted this app for a time and listened to it as it says I should rest. Even when I‚Äôm resting it says I‚Äôm burning both ends of the candle. I‚Äôve gotten blood work and been to the doctors. Nothing wrong. So why is it always saying my body is stressed out? While it seems to give you an ‚Äúidea‚Äù of your general health, it is not a completely accurate marker of health. But they say that as a disclaimer. I can be extremely and fully relaxed and it says my health is at risk. So in that case next step‚Ä¶.look into health issues? I went to my doctor. Got blood work and everything is normal. EKG normal. ECG normal. No cancer. No thyroid issues. Yet this app says I‚Äôm constantly in a state of threatened health. Garbage.
08 March, 2023 at 11:00 PM
Hi there! Thanks a lot for updating your review. We highly appreciate your feedback. Firstly, please note that if auto measurements are the only ones you take, and while taking them, you're moving (walking, for example), it's expected that they are constantly giving you high stress results. It happens because any physical activity is stressful for your body (not in a bad way). Even though walking is excellent and healthy for you, it can affect the accuracy of your measurements' results. Secondly, another cause of the problem might be the low accuracy of your measurements' results. We can only look into it if you contact us via the app. So please go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report.

Subscription plan
crown416
I am Chris‚Äôs to why I can‚Äôt access the monthly payment plan. The app upgrade info says the subscription is 89.99 per year or $7.50 per month. However when I attempted to upgrade the only choice accessible was the annual plan. Where is the monthly choice? Thus, my two stars rating. I want more flexibility in the plan.
08 March, 2023 at 2:03 AM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there.

I expected a more real-time overview. But it updates only a few times a day, sometimes just once and sometimes not even once a day. Most of the time it only updates on your watch when you open the app on your phone. I thought a monthly subscription was possible and wanted to try for a month, but I‚Äôve already paid for a year, too bad. I used this on an Applewatch 8 + iPhone 12 Pro.

Ergebnis h√§ngt nur von der Atmung ab

Ich verstehe den Sinn dieser App leider nicht. Wenn ich schnell einatme und langsam ausatme ist das angezeigte Ergebnis hervorragend. Atme ich hingegen langsam ein und schnell aus ist das angezeigte Ergebnis katastrophal. Durch die Atmung l√§sst sich somit das Ergebnis beliebig selbst beeinflussen.
04 March, 2023 at 9:00 PM
Hallo! Danke f√ºr die Bewertung. Sie haben Recht ‚Äì die Art und Weise, wie Sie atmen, beeinflusst Ihre Herzfrequenz. Befolgen Sie diese Regeln, um hochgenaue Messungen zu erhalten: 1. Legen oder setzen Sie sich mit dem R√ºcken gegen die Stuhllehne. 2. Warten Sie vor der Messung 10‚Äì15 Minuten, bis sich Ihre Herzfrequenz wieder normalisiert hat. 3. Versuchen Sie, sich nicht zu bewegen. Jede Bewegung beeinflusst Ihre Herzfrequenz. 4. Versuchen Sie nicht, Ihre Atmung zu kontrollieren, indem Sie absichtlich tief oder sogar tief durchatmen. Die Art und Weise, wie Sie atmen, beeinflusst Ihre Herzfrequenz, also atmen Sie einfach ganz nat√ºrlich. 5. Rede nicht. Sprechen ver√§ndert Ihren Atemrhythmus.

jtoney76
It‚Äôs been shown that a women‚Äôs cycle affects her HRV and this app is unable to accurately sense that. Maybe if they had an option to put those details in‚Ä¶it might give us a better picture. The app will have you believing you stay stressed when it‚Äôs just your hormones. I wish that was something they could add.
04 March, 2023 at 8:55 PM
Hello there! Thanks a lot for your feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. In general, the situation with the menstruation data and its correlation with HRV is as follows: 1. We know it affects HRV values, and external data proves this. 2. However, based on the external research information, this influence is not very significant and becomes indistinct compared to other activities/events (e.g. workouts, walking, undersleeping, hunger, or stress). Due to these findings, such studies have low priority and will not be considered in the near future. Yet, we will consider adding them to our roadmap after we complete all the research related to specific health conditions. Thank you for bringing it to our attention! Hope you have a great day.

Not for folks that lift heavy weights
rsd22
This app was very appealing to me since I‚Äôm into good health at 64 yrs old. But then I started using it. The app says I am overly stressed each and every day. Well, I am. I lift very heavy weights 3 times a week and my heart rate gets up to 156 easily during my work sets. Lifting heavy weights puts stress on the body, that‚Äôs a given. And on 3 out of my 4 other days I do high intense cardio, mostly intervals. HITT cardio conditioning puts tremendous stress on the body. But to open this app and see that I‚Äôm deathly over my stress limits every day is simply not accurate. I‚Äôm stressed from the lifting and the conditioning I do. The app should have a setting for ‚Äúathletes‚Äù of for people that work out hard and make the necessary adjustments. Just an idea to consider.
04 March, 2023 at 7:11 PM
Hello, and thanks a lot for your feedback. We truly appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to the any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. Please contact us via the app (Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem) or at support@welltory.com, we‚Äôll take a closer look at your data. Hope to hear from you soon.

01 March, 2023 at 12:17 AM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements.

The developers lie, customer service is a joke.
Thundermud
I wanted to purchase the monthly sub for this app which shows it is available. It shows the yearly price OR monthly price. I reached out for customer service and they tell me that the monthly price is the yearly price broken down and that there are no monthly subscriptions. If that‚Äôs the case, you are horrible at math and should really fix the fact that it says you can get either. The yearly is far too expensive for something that doesn‚Äôt sync properly most of the time. I highly recommend getting a different HRV app for anyone who needs it.
24 February, 2023 at 10:00 PM
Hi there, and thanks for leaving your feedback. We're sorry to know you had such a frustrating experience with the app. The thing is that we show the monthly price in the app so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e. it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. We don't have monthly subscriptions in App Store now, and you confirm the amount of payment when you choose to pay for the annual subscription, so there is no lie from us. But we understand that it can be confusing, so thank you for the feedback!

An idea not realized
Eddiemoto
Clearly, this is an example of an idea not truly realized. A shame. I‚Äôve paid for the service for two years hoping to see it improve, but instead I‚Äôm inundated with spam messages asking ti upgrade to lifetime. I can honestly say this app is almost always wrong. I don‚Äôt think it actually does a baseline of your HRV in any way. I‚Äôve tried it with their suggested HRV device, a chest strap and my watch. All come back with similar readings‚Ä¶ this app just interprets it all wrong. If they are following the science with this app‚Ä¶ they need to study some more. A simple example of a daily interaction‚Ä¶ - I wake-up around 4:30. Take my measure which include HRV, blood pressure, O2 and temp. - I get back that I‚Äôm tired and should get a good nights rest. It doesn‚Äôt know my day is starting? - It then tells me my blood pressure is poor. I‚Äôm within range and it is actually pretty good. - I get some silly suggestion. - It tells me I slept‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty good with sleep actually. But always the same stupid puns. All that wrapped up in a 1990s user interface from someones modeled after a MySpace page.
24 February, 2023 at 5:07 PM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. If we compare HRV indicators between apps, then for a correct comparison, it is necessary to use the same RR-intervals, since even measurements taken in parallel by different applications will give different results. In this case, the degree of difference will depend on the calculation algorithms. Different devices and apps pick up the signal differently. If you take measurements with a camera, it is incorrect to compare the results. You can find out why here: https://medium.com/welltory/camera-vs-polar-heart-rate-monitor-68902fb6a2d7 The gold standard for analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) is the Kubios software. It is used for medical purposes. Our frequency-domain scores (RMSSD, SDNN, AMo, pNN50) completely match the Kubios result. We checked it many times. You can check it yourself: 1. Open the web version of our app 2. Export your RR intervals 3. Download Kubios and run the calculation Kubios is free for personal purposes. If you still want to compare the results, it is better to use a Bluetooth heart monitor and take measurements of 300 RR intervals. In contrast, the spectral parameters (Total Power, LF, HF, VLF) can be compared only in parallel but not in sequential measurements. Spectral analysis shows in which direction the state of your body is changing at a particular moment. Considering that this state adjusts to events every millisecond, to the extent that it changes on inhalation and exhalation, when food moves through the intestines, etc., you should not evaluate the general state using the spectral. Spectral analysis is helpful for the following categories of users: 1. Those who take measurements strictly at the same time of day and in the same position and assess whether indicators have dropped. If they have decreased by 2-4 times and stay within these values for more than one morning, this is a sign of problems. 2. For those who conduct meditation or breathing practices to understand that the practice gives exactly the effects that it should, and not vice versa. 3. That is, spectral analysis is like a second snapshot of a state. But the parameters from the main screen (Stress, Productivity, Energy) are more reliable for assessing within the day. Also, we'd really like to look into your data to sort everything out. So please contact us via in-app chat ‚Äî go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report.

Nuiscanxe lifetime subscription offers
ZenPassingThrough
Hello please stop bombarding me with lifetime subscription offers. I have paid for the yearly version as I like the software I don‚Äôt expect to get harassed every few days on my phone and watch to pay you for a lifetime version. Once you have seen the user has cancelled one of the boxes you should not show them the lifetime offer again, unless they request it.
24 February, 2023 at 10:14 AM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We appreciate it as it enables us to further develop and improve our app. Our research shows that with most users, our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. That's why we offer our users to upgrade to the lifetime plan. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact our Support Team via the app: go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your question, and tap Upload. Our Support Engineers will address your request as soon as they can.

Way too expensive
Mr. Tenn
Way too expensive. The yearly subscription price is just about what I‚Äôd pay for a one-time purchase for this app.
24 February, 2023 at 9:15 AM
Hi, and thanks for your feedback. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and well-being within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). Besides, making the app efficient and convenient for every user requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free app version.

Reading the results is like reading horoscopes
81nick18
I had this app for couple of weeks and I have to say, the results summary after each exercise is way off to what the reality is. If I was to follow the advise given by the app I be a couch potato with my feet up all day as apparently my energy levels are always low and I‚Äôm possibly feeling hazy. I can‚Äôt describe how far from how I really feel this is. Also, the overall and masses of info given blended in with all kinds of metrics derived from unreliable measurements makes this app quite counter productive when it comes stress level management. Keep it simple and to the point
23 February, 2023 at 11:42 PM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. It‚Äôs natural to have high stress levels after something challenging, like a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to make sure your stress levels bounce back to normal soon after. If your workout results are not synced with the workout data that you have in Apple Health, please send us a bug report from the app: go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload. We will see why the data can be off.

Love the app, but
piestefan
I honestly love the app and the whole science behind it. One thing I'm missing and can't understand why, is why isn't it possible to trigger Apple watch measurements (way more reliable than camera ones). Another thing: not clear when, how often or how many measurements are automatically getting pulled in from Apple watch. It would be great if you can create a new measurement also via apple watch rather than via camera.
21 February, 2023 at 2:21 AM
We appreciate your positive feedback and are happy to hear you enjoy using our app. ÔªøThe thing is that your Apple Watch decides itself when to take a measurement. You have to be calm at that time and not asleep, not moving, and your heart rate isn't too high. Unfortunately, this option is controlled by Apple Watch, not by Welltory. But you can take a manual measurement with your Apple Watch at any convenient time. Press the Digital Crown to go to the Home screen and open Mindfulness ‚Üí Breathe. Tap the three dots to set the measurement's length to at least 3 minutes. Start the measurement, and remember to stay still while you breathe. To get the most accurate results, make sure your watch fits snugly on top of your wrist and try not to move. Keep silent, and don't aim to control your breath consciously. Check out some useful articles to improve the accuracy of your measurements. When you're done, open Welltory and check out your feed to see the results.

Cool energy levels, but when does it update?

I like that it gives me a calculation of my energy levels, but I‚Äôm sitting here at 3PM looking at my energy levels from midnight last night, and I wore my watch to sleep. It‚Äôs not very helpful to have no insight into it recently.

Still has some work to do
JoAJC99
Welltory still has a ways to go in explaining how they come up with scores from the heart rate variability measurements. My scores can change drastically in the space of a few minutes, with no real indicators or causes that I can identify and attribute to the change. The feedback is often discouraging, especially when it tells you to sit this one out at the beginning of the day, lol. When you scroll through the statistics, it‚Äôs very difficult to tell which day you are looking at. This is really a basic that they need to get right - just print the date for every box of information. Seems like a no-brainer. I‚Äôm supporting this app with a one year membership and hoping they make lots of improvement. This has potential to be useful.
20 February, 2023 at 11:10 PM
Hello there. We appreciate your honest review. We're constantly working to make our app better and will take your feedback into consideration. ÔªøWhen you do measurements with a short period of time between them, they are back-to-back measurements. Sometimes, they can show different results. It usually happens for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. You can check the measurement accuracy yourself in the details of the fuel tank message. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. As for the date, you can see it at the top of the screen when you're scrolling the feed.

Cool app with a lot of improvement possiblities
Dominik Habichtsberg
So far, I like the idea of Welltory. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt really understand, what data pops up when. On some days I had no capture at all, even while wearing my Apple Watch all the day. I get a bunch off notifications but then in my timeline nothing new shows up? Places and rides are captured inaccurate and inconsistently and sometimes the app guesses wrong. Nope, I haven‚Äôt gone shopping. I gave my kids a ride to the kindergarten. The app lacks the option to correct those informations or at least I didn‚Äôt understand how. Sleep data? I saw days where it captured sleep data as if I was done sleeping even if I had 2 hours more sleep after that point. And it didn‚Äôt consider the updated information from apple health. Furthermore it says it captures data from waterminder - but warerminder data doesn‚Äôt even show up at all, even if it says ‚Äûconnected‚Äú. I also don‚Äôt understand, how Tags help by understanding how health data is influenced by the tags. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be an analysis per Tag. Also: when do I add which tag? Before or after? F.e. Tag sleep or Tag children? This is not a point in time. Either I have the kids with me or not for hours. I would wish some better onboarding how to really use tags and how to be able to interpret them. Funny thing: when the app says I should rest because my body is in stress, I feel relaxed. When the app says, that my scores are good (Stress 25%, Energy 75%, Health 100%) it could be that my body feels exhausted. I can feel that my body seems to be tired but as of the app, I shouldn‚Äôt be. Don‚Äôt get it. One last thing. I travel frequently between two time zones back and forth. On average I spend two weeks in the U.S. with my partner and her three kids and 2-3 weeks in Germany with my own two kids. Technically the app should understand, that I have two home locations. I already experienced that other apps have problems with timezone changes. So far I have no clue, how Welltory deals with that. Another wish: being able to add shortcuts via Apple shortcuts by just using my voice without having to open Welltory.

The app doesn‚Äôt load much of its content. Click on something and it takes you to pages that do not load.

Somehow I‚Äôm still alive‚Ä¶
physteach
Just checking in to let the developers know that after 6 months of being told every single day that my stress is above 95%, energy is less than 20% and that my health is below 40%, I‚Äôm still alive and feel great. I‚Äôm in better physical condition than I have been in 20 years, and my weight is at college-days levels, but somehow your program knows more than every other indicator. The developers like to say that the data doesn‚Äôt correlate with how you feel, and I have learned that it doesn‚Äôt correlate with my actual health. Even when I use the Welltory suggestions, the data does not change. I‚Äôm left to wonder‚Ä¶what exactly is the point of this app? It doesn‚Äôt say anything about my health and it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel, so what is the point?? For someone unaware of the limitations, the doom and gloom forecasting could actually become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
18 February, 2023 at 12:29 AM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to the any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. The point of Welltory and these measurements is not to scare you into not doing anything but to give you instruments for self-tracking. You can use this data to see what affects your lifestyle positively and negatively to adjust it and develop healthier habits. It‚Äôs also normal to have anxiety over bad measurements ‚Äî some people struggle with accepting that 5 hours of sleep really does affect their state. But then again, our belief here is that you can only improve what you can measure. It‚Äôs one thing to know that you‚Äôre supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it‚Äôs a whole other thing to see how your body is doing when it has enough time to recover (you can insert any other activity that might have an impact on your health).

Great product. Unreliable heart rate variability tool
Myke0879
Welltory suggests we use the meditation app. on Apple Watch for three minutes to measure HRV and Key Metrics, but it is unreliable. It only works and captures the HRV about 8 out of 10 times. I can see the meditation in the Health app., but Welltory does not show the metrics. Because I have subscribed to the Welltory, this is a frustration.

Too much focus on subconscious stress
Beseeingyou08
The app has a lot of graphs . I used it for the trial period. It relentlessly wants to tell you about stress you have but can‚Äôt feel. The other graphs parse the usual info. I erased it knowing I‚Äôm not stressed in a meaningful way. Resting heart rate is 54.
14 February, 2023 at 11:42 PM
Hello there! Thank you for the feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. Welltory measures physiological stress, not psychological. It reflects your body‚Äôs state, not how you feel. So, it‚Äôs normal to feel okay but have the measurement show you that your body‚Äôs in overdrive. The state of our autonomic nervous system, which is what heart rate variability shows, can coincide with your feelings, but it can also contradict them. Over the years, we‚Äôve heard user stories that state how Welltory helped them get in touch with their bodies and learn to listen to them better, which is fantastic ‚Äî but again, it‚Äôs not always the case. What we‚Äôre saying is that having physiological stress doesn‚Äôt mean feeling bad, at least not all the time. Also, having high stress levels doesn‚Äôt mean you need to lie down immediately and not do anything for the rest of the day ‚Äî but you need to stay mindful and not push yourself too hard (and avoid tough workouts as well ‚Äî overtraining puts a strain on your nervous system).

Sleep data is great!

I love the uncanny way the app knows when fall asleep and wake up. It is usually spot on. I‚Äôd like to know the difference between light, deep and rem sleep as reading the info doesn‚Äôt really tell me. The one problem I have is it‚Äôs always telling me my stress levels are at 90% or higher‚Ä¶ even when Ive been sitting watching tv all day. It‚Äôs always saying chill, hit it brakes, slow down etc. when I‚Äôve been sitting knitting all day. Lol. Those readings are totally wrong as far as I'm concerned.

When it started charging for the HR rate when I exercise that was pretty much out for me. I don‚Äôt know who made that decision but you need to reevaluate it.

Download Umsonst, aber nix ist kostenlos
Manegger
Ich f√ºhle mich verarscht. Mag ja sein dass es eine tolle App ist, aber f√ºr √ºber 80‚Ç¨ im Jahr? Nein Danke! Das ist mir zu teuer. Und auf Deutsch ist es auch nicht. Russisch und Englisch will ich nicht und kann ich nicht.
11 February, 2023 at 9:24 PM
Hallo zusammen und danke f√ºr das Feedback. Wir haben sowohl eine kostenlose als auch eine PRO-Version. Weitere Informationen zu den Unterschieden finden Sie hier: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4007331. Was die kostenpflichtige Version betrifft, so ist Welltory ein ausgekl√ºgeltes Produkt. Es enth√§lt komplexe Algorithmen und jahrzehntelange Gesundheitsforschung. Um die App f√ºr jeden Benutzer effizient und bequem zu machen, ist ein hochqualifiziertes Team von Weltklasse erforderlich, darunter interne Gesundheitswissenschaftler, Datenforscher und Ingenieure, deren Arbeit nicht billig ist und nicht sein sollte. Die vollst√§ndige App-√úbersetzung ist ein Berg an Arbeit, da wir riesige Mengen an Inhalten haben. Wenn wir gen√ºgend Anfragen haben, um in Ihre Sprache zu √ºbersetzen, werden wir sie mit Sicherheit zu unserer Roadmap hinzuf√ºgen und wahrscheinlich √ºbersetzen.

Can somebody say ‚ÄòCashGrab‚Äô
TainoV2
You know I was REALLY interested in this app until the stunt it tried to pull‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm checking all its features until, of course, the notification for full usage: $99.99 per year or $8.33 per month. I figured I can afford the monthly payment, but when you try to subscribe, you ONLY get the $99.99/year option?! What kind of a scam is THAT?! If you just want to pull that kind of amount out of my pocket, don‚Äôt tease with a smaller payment plan if you‚Äôre not gonna offer or honor it!
11 February, 2023 at 5:33 PM
Hi there, thanks for the feedback. Currently, we don't have monthly subscriptions in App Store. We show the monthly price so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e. it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. The in-app monthly plan has been archived. Please email us at support@welltory.com if you need any help with a subscription or the app.

Expensive and inconsistent
Jeajud
This is an expensive and inconsistent app that I paid too money for to be a lifetime member. When it works it gives valuable information about your workouts and whether you need to rest the next day or how long you workout but unfortunately sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt work and you don‚Äôt get that information and next day you get you came short of your workout goal. How can I hit a goal that I‚Äôm unaware of. Also I think the app should tell you throughout the day your progress on stand if they‚Äôre not taking the Apple Watch stand. The visual for the app got the Apple Watch is gorgeous in their ads except on my Apple Watch I never see any of the visual they advertise as available on the Apple Watch. At the end of the day save your money. Not worth it.
11 February, 2023 at 4:40 PM
Hi there! We're sorry to hear that you feel disappointed about your experience with the app. When you say that something doesn't work, could you please tell us more about it? What exactly didn't work for the workouts or daily move goals? Please send us a bug report from the app: go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue in the comments window, and tap Upload. We will have a look in detail at the example of the issue. As per the progress during the day ‚Äî we appreciate your feedback, but right now we don't have this feature. You can always check this data in your Apple Health though, but please note that we use our own calculations for the move goals, you can find information about it in the Help section of the app. As per the ad, you can see a similar interface in the app. The thing is that the full-functional Welltory app works on mobile devices only. It shouldn't work the same way on your Apple Watch. Your watch can take the HRV measurements (manually and automatically), and you get push notifications with measurement reminders, insights, your move goals, or sleep/workouts/activities results.

Apparently I'm always on the verge of collapse
SAEJOCK
I got this app because I liked the idea of having another way to track my health and sleep patterns and work outs. However, I have not been happy with it for the most part. My sleep stats seem to get recorded only sporadically unlike when I first downloaded the app. That's a somewhat minor issue because I can always see them in Apple Health. The more disturbing issue is that, according to the app, I always seem to be overworked, overtired, and/or seemingly on the verge of collapse. I work from home, I get exercise, and aside from gym workouts I don't do much that would put a huge strain on my body. But every notification I get seems to sound the alarm that I'm not well. Even when I have taken a day off from work and am just lounging around the house, my notifications indicate that I'm not doing well. It's al rather confusing and bothersome. And while I have a background in exercise, health, anatomy, and physiology, the info in the app, while I'm sure some in the medical field would find very informative, seems a bit much for users not as versed in those fields. I may hold onto the app for now for basic functions (I ended my annual membership) I don't know how long that will last.
09 February, 2023 at 4:22 PM
Hello there! Thank you for your honest and comprehensive review. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to the any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. Hope you will find this information helpful. Please contact us via in-app chat (Menu ‚Üí Help & Support ‚Üí chat icon), and we‚Äôll take a closer look at your data. Hope to hear from you soon.

Scam?
GeoRay122445
I purchased this app PRO version and I was charged twice and the app keeps on telling me the trial version expired. I deleted the account and reinstall the app again but with a different email and then went to settings and RESTORE PURCHASE and I get a message that is now restore but keeps on saying I should upgrade. I used my Apple ID for this purchase and the WELLTORY seller never sent me a receipt of my purchase all I have is my Apple Card‚Äôs charges. There‚Äôs no phone number to call for support and if you text them via app they say they have a great volume of inquires to respond so it may take days if not never. I want a refund because this app is not working for me and I was double charged the amount of $87.09 twice . This is a scam

Inconsistent Range
Yub3tawatchout
There are some good data points but I don‚Äôt like how the energy/health range vary so much in a matter of an hour. Leads me to believe this is inaccurate ( I am working at a desk when the variance happens at times )
07 February, 2023 at 7:38 PM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements. You can read more about it here: https://help.welltory.com/articles/4253039.

I gave this app a week and I have to say, it‚Äôs not great! For the past 7 days, it tells me every day that my stress levels are above 90% and need to chill. I went for a morning walk, afterwards 99% stress level!! I‚Äôm honestly not stressed in the least. I tried to alter my fitness regime to all different types of activities but no success. Every day I‚Äôm above 90% Looking at the app is more stressful! Either that or I should go to hospital for a check up! I‚Äôm a very fit and healthy person and looking at this app, actually make me stress more!

The data is useless and the back and forth with tech support has yielded no help. While there are lots of fancy charts and analytics, this does not yield any data that is accurate at all.

Monthly subscription is missing
duisiya
The monthly subscription is missing. They say that it is available through the requests in the chat but the chat is currently disabled too. It‚Äôs a pity, I was really looking forward to try the pro feature but am not ready to commit to the yearly subscription. Why not add the monthly subscription to the app? Is it some sort of marketing trick?
02 February, 2023 at 1:09 PM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and wellbeing within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store. If you prefer to manage your subscriptions through App Store, you can choose other plans available there.

Too Complicated
td.mcmahan
This app is too complicated and many of the readings display contradictory information. Some elements tell me my stress is perfect to scroll down and the next element tells me to take it easy - your stress is in overdrive. They only offer a yearly subscription as I am sure they know the information isn‚Äôt consistent through out all content sections of the app. I got bored and frustrated and cancelled but I am stuck with the app for year because the app isn‚Äôt monthly. Yes, there was a trial. But it was too short of a period to really understand the nuances of this app. It‚Äôs not worth the price.

Lifetime subscription

I do love all the features and options this app has. The one issue I have is trying to give them more money actually. I keep try to tap the discount button for a lifetime subscription but nothing happens. I opened a ticket with support and there answer was I don‚Äôt have enough money to buy the subscription. Huh?!?! How do they know how much money I have in my account attached to my phone? I can answer that question now‚Ä¶.WRONG!!! Why would I try and buy an app I can‚Äôt afford. Wouldn‚Äôt that be pretty stupid. I‚Äôve even tried with a pre-paid Apple Pay Card. Clicking that ad button within the app doesn‚Äôt work guys. At least for me it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve updated the OS, shut the phone off and turned it back on. Still no luck. I give up. Guess I won‚Äôt be giving any money when this one expires. Thanks for the memories though.

No Mindfulness data since new version

For a month now, ever since the new version no mindfulness breathe data is loaded, despite two emails to the support. No error messages, nothing - I can see the data in my health app, but this app no longer import and provides any analysis. Not good!

Not that great
Flashyzipp
I am in good health and 60 years old. According to this app, I am under extreme stress. There is 0 stress in my life. We live in Florida and love life. Lol
27 January, 2023 at 4:18 PM
Hello there! Thanks a lot for your feedback. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to the any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. I hope you will find this information helpful. Please contact us via in-app chat (Menu ‚Üí Help & Support ‚Üí chat icon) or at support@welltory.com, we‚Äôll take a closer look at your data.

Ridiculous
thatbillgiy
This app listed that I was ‚ÄúNot Very Active‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorkout Often.‚Äù It sugesated I have no energy and that while my heart rate was good, there are signs of problems that could lead to cardiovascular disease. Which is in direct conflict with my actual cardiologist. App is trash trying to sell you stuff based on manufactured fear.
26 January, 2023 at 2:38 PM
Hi there, thank you for your review and we're sorry to hear that you got disappointed with the app. We never tell users that they might have problems that can lead to any diseases because Welltory is not a medical app. It is not intended to be utilized for medical purposes and is not intended to substitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. So, if you saw something like diagnoses in the app, please send us a bug report with the screenshot of the text ‚Äî we will see what kind of miscommunication there could be.

Hi there, and thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it's a degree of tension in the body's regulatory systems.

If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can't respond adequately to any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, then your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn't recover yet - most often it's either overworking, or working out too much.

Research not peer reviewed, shady business practices
timl2k9
The app states that the pro subscription is x dollars a month, but a monthly subscription is not offered. There is no way to evaluate in just 5 days if an app is worth an annual subscription. The research that they pin their ‚Äúliquid message‚Äù on is not peer reviewed and therefore could be nonsense for all anyone knows. In my experience the ‚Äúliquid message‚Äù is wildly inaccurate and does not reflect anything at all that is going on with my body. Also it seems to overload you with ideas about how to live your life. Trust your gut, not this app. It does have some good objective metrics based on Heart Rate variability, but those metrics are drowned out in the noise.
21 January, 2023 at 2:45 PM
Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. Currently, we don't have monthly subscriptions in App Store. We show the monthly price so that you can estimate how much it would be per month. It's a monthly breakdown of an annual price, i.e. it‚Äôs only available if you subscribe to an annual plan. The message with the colored liquid shows you how your body is doing right now ‚Äì it‚Äôs a personalized interpretation of the heart rate variability metrics you see in your chart message, based on Welltory‚Äôs proprietary algorithms.

Interesting app and metrics. The erroneous articles that post throughout the day are VERY annoying and the primary reason that I will not renew premium. There should be an option to disable them. The other factor; I have a congenital heart defect which affects my blood pressure and heart rate thus the measurements are skewed which is not a fault of the app just me.
20 January, 2023 at 2:30 PM
Hi. Thank you for sharing feedback. We're sorry you feel this way about the app. Can you please concretise what articles are erroneous? We'll pass your feedback on to our team. About your heart condition ‚Äî you can specify all meds you're taking (and your medical conditions) in the Do you have any health risks? self-test. To find it, please, go to Menu ‚Üí Self-tests. All of them will be taken into account after that. We also recommend completing other health-related self-tests. Please note that both your meds affect the heart rate and, therefore, can influence the HRV results. We recommend measuring an hour after taking them to minimise their influence on measurement results. Plus, you can mark them in your feed with tags, making tracking the time more manageable. Kindly let us know if you have any further questions.

The app is great, but the in-app purchases are not. I am willing to pay for the service, but the monthly subscription is only available on the website. I understand the developer's reasoning for not wanting to pay a cut to Apple, but I prefer the convenience of managing my subscription through the App Store
20 January, 2023 at 12:42 AM
Hi, and thanks for the feedback. We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused. Our research shows that with most users, our app helps achieve significant positive changes in their lifestyle and wellbeing within several months. Our app is more effective in the long term, as the self-training algorithm needs to get to know you, and it takes time and data about your body's state, activities, habits, etc. to form baselines. Moreover, some features only become available later on in your journey with our app, when there is enough data to provide you with interesting findings (e.g. personalized research that shows how two data sets affect each other based on your individual health and wellness data from the sources you've connected to the app). That's why we're going to gradually remove the monthly plan from all platforms, and we've already archived it in App Store.

HRV rarely finishes a measurement on iPhone
caseyjayner
I don‚Äôt have an Apple Watch but I bought the subscription as I was impressed the first two days. Sometimes the measurement would crash but it never took more than 10 mins to complete a reading with good accuracy. I‚Äôve now had the app 5 days and the past two days it won‚Äôt complete a single measurement. I‚Äôve tried 7 times in a row both days totaling more than 30 mins each time. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and if I could I wouldn‚Äôt have bought the app since it so rarely works now. I wanted to take 6+ measures/day as I have chronic illness but even with my persistence I only had 2 complete yesterday and one today.
19 January, 2023 at 11:29 PM
Hi there! Please, try to hold the tip of your finger over the camera, not too firmly, do not move, and do not control your breathing.

I was testing two apps and I would reference my HRV score in the Apple health app against what both apps showed and this app would show an HRV score that was completely different than the HRV in the Apple health app! How can I trust this app if the data in the source is even different than what the app is showing. I gave it all access to my health data. I need an app that will show the same data as the source so I know it‚Äôs working at the least.
18 January, 2023 at 6:02 AM
Hi, thank you for your feedback! HRV score is not the metric that Apple Watch measures. Your Stress, Energy, and Health scores are calculated based on the standard HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN, etc.) shown in messages with a chart. SDNN ‚Äî standard deviation of normal heartbeat intervals and one of the most critical heart rate variability metrics ‚Äî is what is measured by Apple Watch. HRV Score assesses heart rate variability based on lnRMSSD ‚Äî the natural logarithm of RMSSD. In turn, RMSSD is a key variability metric reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity.

1. The graphics that you see in the ad, are NOT the same in the app. 2. EVERYTHING in this app says you are stressed. ALL the recommendations, answers to self test (even when you answer the questions to say your life and emotions are great) you receive the same response as if you answered you were on deaths bed. 3. All of the advice are from generic articles. Nothing is tailored the unique YOU. 4. Waste of money. ( yes, I paid for the full program) unsubscribed and will never return. Apple please remove this fraudulent app.

Hello, thank you for your review! We're sorry you've had a such negative experience with the app. 1. You can see a similar interface in the app. Your Apple Watch can take the HRV measurements, and you get push notifications with measurement reminders, insights, your move goals, or sleep/workouts/activities results on the watch. There will be more features on the watch app soon. 2. When do you usually do measurements? And do you do them with camera or with Apple Watch (manually or automatically)? Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. 3. Have you checked the My Data section? You can find the correlations of your data there. Also, the scientific correlations that we send once a week to your feed with the two types of data that are related, to help you improve your health. 4. If you purchased in App Store, to request a refund, please contact Apple as according to Apple's policies, all operations related to products purchased in App Store are processed only on Apple's side. You can find details on how to request a refund in our Help articles. To facilitate the process, we recommend contacting Apple Support by phone. Kindly let us know if you have any further questions.

Hi there, we're sorry that you're not happy about our app's feedback. But measurement results largely depend on the accuracy ‚Äî if it's below 90%, the result is unreliable. To get the most accurate results, measure in the same position (lying or sitting with your back straight), don't move or talk, and breathe naturally.

Almost a scam
Prefernot
This app offers no free trial, so you must purchase on day 1 to use any of the features. Once purchased, I found that it basically regurgitates information it collects from other less expensive or free apps. Most of the information it repurposes comes from the Apple health app, but it will also use information from my AutoSleep and Withings apps. I haven‚Äôt found anything new this app adds beyond what is already available through Apple health.

Far too many notifications!
Healthyvillage
Interesting app but it‚Äôs impossible to keep notifications on since there are new ones all the time! Wouldn‚Äôt it be better with a daily summary instead of the spam like notifications where there often even comes more than one notification at the time! The app could be really good if that is fixed.
09 January, 2023 at 2:26 PM
Hi, and thank you for the feedback! We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. Please note that you can schedule the time in your iPhone settings to receive a summary of notifications each day so, you can catch up when it's convenient for you. The summary is personalized to you and ordered by priority based on how you use your apps, with the most relevant notifications at the top. To schedule a notification summary: ‚Äì Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Scheduled Summary, then turn on Scheduled Summary. ‚Äì Under Apps in Summary, select the apps that you want to include in your notification summary. ‚Äì Under Schedule, tap the Add button to add a new schedule or the Remove button to remove a schedule. Then adjust the time for each scheduled summary you have set up. ‚Äì To add new apps to the summary, go back to Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Scheduled Summary and select the apps under Apps in Summary. Each app appears with a number showing the average number of notifications that you receive each day from that app.

Horrible and not accurate app
Satorispring
This is a horrible and inaccurate app that stop‚Äôs suddenly and doesn‚Äôt measure for days. I signed up for a year and canceled after 1-2 days. It was a waste of money and I feel cheated. DO NOT download or subscribe. It lies and cheats.
08 January, 2023 at 7:04 PM
Hello there. Thank you for your feedback. In Welltory, your HRV is analyzed by a self-learning algorithm. Its calculations are based on both standard heart rate variability metrics and your individual data. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll take some time for the algorithm to form your baseline and learn more about your body‚Äôs usual state. To train the algorithm: 1. Take measurements at the same time every morning for a week or two (note that in Welltory, morning measurements are the ones taken between 5.00 AM and 12.00 PM). 2. Take measurements after waking up but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. You can also use the bathroom or drink water, but then you‚Äôll need to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before taking a measurement. 3. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). 4. If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. 5. When the algorithm forms your baseline, you‚Äôll see the relevant notification in your feed. And if something is not working correctly, please send us a bug report ‚Äî we'll need it to look into the problem. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report.

Great App at first
Janet421
I have used this app for a year. I accidentally paid for a year, but used it daily and it helped tremendously. Until the last few weeks. Now? Doesn‚Äôt work like it did. Missing graphics. Tech support responds, but I am thinking they have outgrown their Servers. I am due to renew. If it worked like it did this past year, I would consider the large cost. Otherwise, I will find another app because Welltory is not working like it had.

Measurement at 10:36am: 74% stress, 26% Energy & 40% Health Measurement at 2:39pm : 22% stress, 66% Energy & 100% Health How can your body change within 4 hours? A total reversal in measurements? Don‚Äôt buy this app subscription!! You will stress out more than it helps.
07 January, 2023 at 10:48 AM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements. You can read more about it here: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/4253039.

Think this is hogwash
gammaJames3
I work 12-16 hour midnight shifts. Using an Apple Watch for readings, my energy level will be 75% after I been up for 20 hours at 6am. While I‚Äôm sleeping, the reading will be 15%. After getting 6-8 hours of sleep, my readings will continue to be relatively low. So when I‚Äôm about to pass out from a long day, this app says I have a lot of energy and am ready to take on the day, but after I sleep and am working (and feeling great) this app tells me my energy is lacking. Either I am a mutant, or this app isn‚Äôt as sophisticated as it makes itself out to be.
06 January, 2023 at 8:55 AM
Hi there, I'm sorry you didn't find our app useful. However, the fact that your measurement results do not match your feelings doesn't imply the app is working incorrectly. The thing is, heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you. Sometimes, the way you physically feel may differ from the key insights you get after taking a measurement. And it‚Äôs ok. Many different things can have a bearing on how you feel ‚Äî from events in your life and diseases affecting your hormone and neurotransmitter levels to caffeine, nicotine, and other substances. You may feel energized when your body needs a break. Or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. This is exactly where HRV measurements are helpful ‚Äî they show you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. The way your body responds to stressful situations depends on the way your autonomic nervous system works ‚Äî its sympathetic and parasympathetic parts. The level of energy reflects your parasympathetic nervous system activity. Although you can be under a lot of pressure, your parasympathetic system can be active enough for your body to recover quickly. Please note that your measurement results also don't reflect your emotional response to stress. That's why it may be confusing: although your body may have enough resources to recover, your emotional state may not be so great. There are situations when your body's coping well, and there are others when it's doing a little worse.

It doesn‚Äôt use the watch for heartbeat. It has you put your finger on the camera to measure heart rate data. What a waste
05 January, 2023 at 8:22 PM
Hi. Welltory is an app that helps people restore balance in their lives by managing their stress and energy. This balance lets you stay energized throughout the day, get in shape, be more productive and feel great generally. We use a method called cardiointervalography in order to analyze heart rate variability, which reflects the state of a person‚Äôs sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

Falsche Auswertungen, nicht zum empfehlen
Sjaak007
Ich hatte gute Hoffnungen das diese App ein Ersatz sein konnte f√ºr der Garmin Stress/Schlaf/Body-Batterie Auswertung. Leider ist der Trainings Auswertung komplett falsch. Wenn ich z.B. ein Wettkampf gemacht habe von mehr als eine Stunde, gibt der App an 30seconden fatburn oder 3 minuten cardio. Der n√§chste Tag der Empfehlung, um mehr Sport zu machen. Mein Training wird gut aufgezeichnet! Andere Apps (Garmin, Trainingpeaks, TodayPlan, Athletics, TrainToday etc) geben die Auswertung richtig an. So es ist definitiv ein/mehrere Fehler in diese app. Auch gibt diese App sehr viel Push Nachrichten. Leider ist nicht ein zu stellen welche Type Push Nachrichten man wohl oder nicht habe mochte. Nach fast zwei Monaten Kontakt zu haben mit Support √ºber der falsche Auswertungen, leider noch immer kein Verbesserung. Darum der 1* Bewertung. Schade, die App hat viel Potenzen. Hoffentlich bekommen der App Developers es hin um der App brauchbar zu machen. Leider -am Moment- nicht zu benutzen und nicht zu empfehlen.

Hallo, danke f√ºr dein Feedback! Leider ist das Finden und Beheben von Fehlern keine leichte und einfache Aufgabe. Wenn Sie sich mit dem Support-Team in Verbindung gesetzt haben, sollte es Ihnen gesagt haben, dass es das Problem zuerst untersuchen muss, um festzustellen, ob es sich um einen massiven Fehler handelt oder ob es sich um ein individuelles Problem handelt. Bisher werden die Workouts f√ºr unsere anderen Nutzer korrekt analysiert, es gibt keinen massiven Bug in unserer App. Deshalb ist es etwas komplizierter, Ihr Problem zu untersuchen. Bitte versuchen Sie erneut, unser Support-Team zu kontaktieren, um zu sehen, ob es Ihnen eine alternative M√∂glichkeit zur Synchronisierung Ihres Tracking-Ger√§ts f√ºr die Trainingsanalyse anbieten kann.

Sehr umfassendes und gutes Tool. Ein riesiges Manko ist aber der Umstand, dass die Analysen sehr umfangreich und textlastig sind und genau das ist das Problem, denn sie werden ausschlie√ülich in englischer Sprache angeboten. Das mindert den Wert erheblich f√ºr nicht native Speaker, denn genau diese Analysen sind teilweise komplex, und wer nicht richtig gutes Englisch spricht hat ein Probleme damit. Schade, denn eine gute √úbersetzung ist heute endlich kein Problem mehr.

Quiz√° sea completa, pero es farragosa e incomprensible.
Curro C√∫chares
Muchos Datos. Muchos datos. Eso no significa NECESARIAMENTE que den informaci√≥n veraz, cre√≠ble o √∫til. Eso define a mi juicio a Welltory. Gran cantidad de datos y m√©tricas incomprensibles que te hacen pensar que est√°s en la antesala de la muerte. Uso Fitiv Pulse para mis entrenamientos y muy bien. Me da informaci√≥n fiable, completa y sencilla. En Welltory no bajo de 90% de Stress ni subo de 50% de Salud. Me siento fenomenal. Pero si le hago caso tendr√≠a que ir corriendo al m√©dico. No s√© muy bien que pretende. Las complicaciones para Apple Watch simples. Y PARA NADA pagar por una aplicaci√≥n que no pretende estar en Castellano. Muy mala experiencia.
29 December, 2022 at 1:46 AM
¬°Hola! Gracias por los comentarios. Tenga en cuenta que la variabilidad de la frecuencia card√≠aca (HRV) no refleja su estado de √°nimo o estado emocional. Muestra c√≥mo reaccionan tu coraz√≥n y tu sistema nervioso ante lo que te est√° pasando y lo que tu cuerpo est√° experimentando en este momento. Esta es exactamente la raz√≥n por la cual las mediciones de HRV son √∫tiles. Medimos el estr√©s f√≠sico en lugar del emocional. Es natural tener altos niveles de estr√©s despu√©s de algo desafiante, como un entrenamiento. Sin embargo, es importante asegurarse de que sus niveles de estr√©s vuelvan a la normalidad poco despu√©s. Seg√∫n el idioma espa√±ol, la traducci√≥n completa de la aplicaci√≥n es una monta√±a de trabajo, ya que tenemos una gran cantidad de contenido. Si tenemos suficientes solicitudes para traducir a su idioma, lo agregaremos a nuestra hoja de ruta con seguridad y probablemente lo traduciremos.

Unique app with the bad business practices
Renshia
I used this app for 5-6 months on and off after discovering I have tachycardia during a hospital stay. I liked it because not only could I track my heart rate (which I found typically increased around neurological attacks and syncope) but I could also see the HRV and a health/energy score. There were some frustrations, like low accuracy via camera after changing positions (making it useless for testing/tracking POTS) or when there‚Äôs normal background noise, having to recalibrate for days after taking a break from morning measurements, and oversized+convoluted graphs. But overall, it really helped shed some insight into my health allowing me to prevent, track, and recover from neuro & syncope episodes. I planned on getting an Apple Watch after the new year to help with the accuracy issues and depending on how my cardiology appt goes, purchasing pro. But after Dec 22, the developers decided to limit displaying heart rate to only pro members with no warning or explanation in update logs or FAQ (I learned this from Customer service). Such basic information, it‚Äôs ridiculous that one would have to use a separate free app for that then track the hrv, etc on Welltory. If anything should be behind a paywall, it should be the health journal, HRV metrics (SDNN is vague without the paywalled details anyway), or all those random health recommendations in the feed, NOT simple heart rate. I‚Äôve experienced so many barriers to care and health information already, hence it taking 6 months to see a specialist‚ÄîI won‚Äôt support a company that 1. Secretly and suddenly puts a pay wall on basic heart rate and 2. Hides access to their monthly subscription model behind customer service. It‚Äôs all not only a bad business move but also senseless and shady.
28 December, 2022 at 11:49 PM
Hi there! First of all, thanks a lot for the detailed feedback about your experience with the app! We really want our users to continue enjoying the app and monitoring their health, and Heart Rate is indeed a simple and useful metric. We've forwarded your feedback about the Heart Rate metrics to the product team, and we will try to get it back for free users soon, however, there is no ETA yet. Thanks a lot for bringing up this topic! We're glad to improve the app for our users. As per the monthly subscription, the in-app monthly plan has been archived and is now available only via our web interface. Please go to https://app.welltory.com, and you will see you can purchase the monthly plan there. Don't forget to log in to your Welltory account.

Did not work for me
Elkdude
In the past week it told me I was too stressed and poor health - on vacation days where I was relaxed and having a wonderful time with my family. I get a bad head cold, felt terrible and it gives me all green / good readings. The measurements are also only a few times per day and the watch complication usually shows data that‚Äôs a day old - which is completely useless. Unless you‚Äôre making a journal of what was happening every hour of your day, and try to correlate the data.
27 December, 2022 at 11:14 PM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. If you‚Äôre sick but still have high energy scores, your body is doing a decent job maintaining homeostasis. Health is your body‚Äôs ability to maintain homeostasis regardless of what may be happening to you. This metric is important to monitor when you‚Äôre sick, because it shows how well your body is coping. A high level of health means you‚Äôre doing alright, even if you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms, while a low one is a sign the illness is taking a toll on you.

What a waste of money
Chris Al
This has been a complete waste of ¬£73.00 for me. The app would only allow me to commit to an annual subscription. Adding to this the algorithms suggest that I‚Äôm exhausted, with low energy and at serious risk of illness whether I‚Äôm working or at rest on holiday. I‚Äôm not impressed and I don‚Äôt agree with the calculations. I think you can commit to a monthly subscription on their website. Try a month first if you want to give it a go.
24 December, 2022 at 8:09 PM
Hello there! Thank you for the feedback. We truly appreciate it. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often it‚Äôs either overworking, or working out too much. I hope you will find this information helpful. Please contact us via in-app chat (Menu ‚Üí Help & Support ‚Üí chat icon), and we‚Äôll take a closer look at your data. Hope to hear from you soon.

Overfitted for the stressed and overworked
AllWhoWander321
Just started using this so I may need to update this review after it calibrates. But, currently what it says and how I feel are polar opposites. My current hypothesis is that the data set used to train the models of this service are over fitted to individuals who are stressed to begin with and are looking for apps to reduce stress. Or, athletes in high pressure positions. Personally, I‚Äôm not feeling stressed but this app is giving me nonsensical advice on a daily basis
21 December, 2022 at 2:28 AM
Hi there, and thank you for the feedback. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. Also, in Welltory, your HRV is analyzed by a self-learning algorithm. Its calculations are based on both standard heart rate variability metrics and your individual data. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll take some time for the algorithm to form your baseline and learn more about your body‚Äôs usual state.

Hi, and thank you for your feedback. We‚Äôre sorry you had such a frustrating experience with our app, as we strive incredibly hard to make every customer experience enjoyable. We changed the view and added non-measurement events to your journal so you can understand your results better. For example, if you have measurements in the morning, afternoon, and evening, these tags can help you see what may have triggered changes in your results throughout the day. Also, we added the calendar in the preview, which shows a long-term overview of changes in your wellbeing. If you want to have your data in one table, you can export all your measurements via our web interface.

Austin5510
Continuously says I have 90%+ stress when I feel relaxed. Multiple other apps show relaxed, which is how I feel. Continuous feeds stating to meditate or what-not that is repeated. I meditate regularly. Even at 50% off I feel like wasted money. Repeat every day no matter the change in life style adjustments. Even changed medication to change heart patterns (for other reasons) and no change on their predictions. Constant feed and notifications staying to do the same ridiculous changes, which aren‚Äôt helpful. Also, pre-buy states you can edit your feed but you can‚Äôt. Only delete the same repetitive crap every day. More of a nuisance in my opinion.

Wellatory states I‚Äôm stressed, and it's affecting my energy output. My body fat is around 10%. After the update, the accuracy reading was 60%; before the update, it was 100 percent.

Hi there, and thank you for your feedback, we appreciate it. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is really experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs normal when your stress level is high after certain events, e.g. after a workout. However, it‚Äôs important to improve the accuracy of your measurements. When your measurement‚Äôs accuracy is high enough (95‚Äì100%), it means that the results on your screen closely reflect what‚Äôs going on with your body. To get high-accuracy measurements, please, follow these rules: lie down or sit down with your back against the back of the chair; before taking a measurement, wait for 10‚Äì15 minutes to let your heart rate get back to normal; try not to move ‚Äî any movement affects your heart rate; don‚Äôt try to control your breathing, intentionally taking deep or even breaths; don‚Äôt talk ‚Äî talking changes your breathing rhythm. If you‚Äôre using your phone‚Äôs camera, the image quality may be affected by your finger‚Äôs position on the camera and flash or the light intensity in the room (it should be neither too bright nor too dark). You can read more about how to take accurate heart rate variability measurements in our help articles.

For an overall idea on how your body is doing, it does a great job at that! But the get actual tips and use the ai, you have to pay for it.

If they made it where you can pay by month, I would be a lot more happy with this app.
17 December, 2022 at 8:15 AM
Hi there. Thank you for the feedback. Welltory is a sophisticated product. It packs complex algorithms and decades of health research. To make the app efficient and convenient for every user, it requires a highly qualified, world-class team, including in-house health scientists, data researchers, and engineers whose work is not and should not be cheap. We also have a free version of the app where you can take measurements for free forever, but only with a limited description. We have promos fairly often, during which we offer discounts, so you might want to look out for those. Regarding monthly subscription ‚Äî the in-app monthly plan has been archived and is now available only via our web interface.

Apple Watch David B.
Ich habe die App zwar gerade erst heruntergeladen, jedoch bringt sie sehr interessante Funktionen und Einsichten in den k√∂rperlichen Zustand. Jedoch gibt es bei mir noch einen schwerwiegenden Fehler, wodurch ich nicht alles zu 100% nutzen kann. Die Sprache bei viele Ansichten, wie zum Beispiel beim Einsehen von vergangenen Tagen, ist russisch. W√§re es wenigstens dauerhaft auf Englisch, w√§re es kein Problem, aber die russichen W√∂rter geben mir zu wenig zu verstehen, was in den Ansichten beschrieben wird. Ein Beispiel ist zum Beispiel das ‚ÄûHealt Journal‚Äú Wenn das behoben wird gebe ich auch gerne mehr Sterne.

Dachte erst super, aber nach l√§ngerer Benutzung‚Ä¶
ShiroAndae
Erst fand ich es super, weil ich v.a. einen Ersatz f√ºr die Stressanzeige gesucht habe, die ich bei Garmin hatte. Mittlerweile halte ich sie aber f√ºr sehr unzuverl√§ssig - ich hatte gestern in 8 Minuten Abstand ein Reading in dem ich extrem erholt, nicht gestresst und gesund war und direkt darauf dann 90% Stress, v√∂llig am Ende und vor Krankheit stehend war. Ich habe nicht trainiert oder sonst etwas, es ist nichts passiert. Zudem schl√§gt die App st√§ndig vor, es leicht zu nehmen und sich erholen - aber der einzige Weg den Wert wirklich nach oben zu bekommen ist Sport (sich ausruhen macht es manchmal schlimmer). Ergo hilft es auch nicht, gute Trainingszeitpunkte zu finden. Nur‚Ä¶ wozu n√ºtzt es dann? Die Schlafqualit√§t wird auch nicht sehr gut ausgewertet und ist gerne mal voll daneben‚Ä¶

Hallo, danke f√ºr die Bewertung! Es tut uns leid zu h√∂ren, dass Sie von Ihrer Erfahrung mit der App entt√§uscht sind. Ihre aufeinanderfolgenden Messungen zeigen normalerweise aus zwei Gr√ºnden unterschiedliche Ergebnisse: Entweder hat sich die Messgenauigkeit (je h√∂her die Messqualit√§t ‚Äì desto genauer die Ergebnisse) oder Ihr emotionaler/physischer Zustand ge√§ndert. Die Herzfrequenzvariabilit√§t reagiert sehr empfindlich auf selbst kleinste Ver√§nderungen, einschlie√ülich sowohl externer Faktoren als auch Anpassungen, die in Ihrem K√∂rper stattfinden. Prozesse in Ihrem K√∂rper h√∂ren nie auf: Nahrungsverdauung, Hormonproduktion, Kontrolle des Gef√§√ütonus. Aus diesem Grund k√∂nnen R√ºcken-an-R√ºcken-Messungen manchmal leicht unterschiedliche Ergebnisse zeigen. Es k√∂nnen jedoch auch gr√∂√üere Unterschiede auftreten ‚Äì normalerweise in den unten beschriebenen Situationen: 1. Sie nehmen R√ºcken-an-R√ºcken-Messungen vor, nachdem Sie sich eine Weile bewegt haben. 2. Es gibt Verschiebungen in Ihrem sympathischen/parasympathischen Gleichgewicht. 3. Sie messen direkt nach dem Aufwachen R√ºcken an R√ºcken. 4. Sie standen oder sa√üen w√§hrend der Messung in einer unbequemen Position. 5. Sie haben w√§hrend oder zwischen aufeinanderfolgenden Messungen Ihre Facebook-Seite √ºberpr√ºft, telefoniert usw. Senden Sie uns gem√§√ü den Fehlern in den Schlaf- und Trainingsergebnissen bitte einen Fehlerbericht mit den Details ‚Äì wir k√∂nnen einen Blick darauf werfen und untersuchen, ob es ein Problem gibt. Um einen Fehlerbericht von der App zu senden, gehen Sie zu Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem.

So far I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 days and I‚Äôm not impressed whatsoever. I‚Äôve yet to have a measurement accuracy of 95% or greater for my HRV. They say for the data to be accurate you need at least a 95% measurement accuracy. I‚Äôve tried all of their directions on measuring my HRV and never get above a 65%, no matter what I do. And, the directions in the app to change settings in your iPhone to get a better measurement simple don‚Äôt exist. What they tell you to do doesn‚Äôt exist in ‚Äúsettings‚Äù.

This software is based on heart measurements that just flat out do not give an accurate read of your health under certain circumstances.
14 December, 2022 at 2:37 AM
Hi there! We‚Äôre sorry that the app didn‚Äôt meet your expectations. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. To get accurate results, you need to stick to several simple rules. It‚Äôs essential because your heart responds to everything: your results can be affected not only by your position during the measurement but also by the food you‚Äôve eaten, the emotions you‚Äôve experienced, the way you breathe, etc. You can find more about measurement accuracy in the Help section of the app (Menu ‚Äî Help & Support).

Limited features

I quite liked hrv analysis. Pitty you cannot request it to be generated, need to wait for the app to generate one for you what happened at random times. This feature disappeared on Dec 4th though and did not come back even after the recent update. Right now it‚Äôs just a boring feed with summary of events from apple health - not really useful as the app does not offer much of an analysis
13 December, 2022 at 10:18 PM
Hi, and thank you for your feedback! If you mean the automatic HRV measurements ‚Äî this still works in the latest update. But Apple Watch takes such measurements only when you're calm and relaxed, not moving, and your heart rate isn't too high. Nor Welltory, nor user, can change this time. But you can always take a manual measurement with your Apple Watch and the Mindfulness/Breathe app ‚Äî you'll receive the HRV results in your feed as usual.

Not accurate
HRV hopeful
I was hoping the finger over the camera would be accurate, compared to another app that I have to use a chest strap HR monitor. It‚Äôs not. No matter how carefully I place my finger, or not move, it always says that the reading was inaccurate. I was hoping this would eliminate the need for a HR monitor, but definitely not there yet.
12 December, 2022 at 4:54 PM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback. If we compare HRV indicators between apps, then for a correct comparison, it is necessary to use the same RR-intervals, since even measurements taken in parallel by different applications will give different results. In this case, the degree of difference will depend on the calculation algorithms. Different devices and apps pick up the signal differently. If you take measurements with a camera, it is incorrect to compare the results. You can find out why here: https://medium.com/welltory/camera-vs-polar-heart-rate-monitor-68902fb6a2d7 The gold standard for analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) is the Kubios software. It is used for medical purposes. Our frequency-domain scores (RMSSD, SDNN, AMo, pNN50) completely match the Kubios result. We checked it many times. You can check it yourself: 1. Open the web version of our app 2. Export your RR intervals 3. Download Kubios and run the calculation Kubios is free for personal purposes. If you still want to compare the results, it is better to use a Bluetooth heart monitor and take measurements of 300 RR intervals. In contrast, the spectral parameters (Total Power, LF, HF, VLF) can be compared only in parallel but not in sequential measurements. Spectral analysis shows in which direction the state of your body is changing at a particular moment. Considering that this state adjusts to events every millisecond, to the extent that it changes on inhalation and exhalation, when food moves through the intestines, etc., you should not evaluate the general state using the spectral. Spectral analysis is helpful for the following categories of users: 1. Those who take measurements strictly at the same time of day and in the same position and assess whether indicators have dropped. If they have decreased by 2-4 times and stay within these values for more than one morning, this is a sign of problems. 2. For those who conduct meditation or breathing practices to understand that the practice gives exactly the effects that it should, and not vice versa. 3. That is, spectral analysis is like a second snapshot of a state. But the parameters from the main screen (Stress, Productivity, Energy) are more reliable for assessing within the day. Also, in Welltory, your HRV is analyzed by a self-learning algorithm. Its calculations are based on both standard heart rate variability metrics and your individual data. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôll take some time for the algorithm to form your baseline and learn more about your body‚Äôs usual state. So, your algorithm may be not trained enough. To train it: 1. Take measurements at the same time every morning during a week or two (note that in Welltory, morning measurements are the ones taken between 5.00 AM and 12.00 PM). 2. Take measurements after waking up, but before working out, taking a shower, or eating breakfast. After you wake up, stay in bed for 5‚Äì10 minutes (don‚Äôt talk or check the news) and then take a measurement. You can use the bathroom or drink some water, too, but then you‚Äôll need to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before taking a measurement. 3. Always use the same position to take measurements (lying or sitting with your back against the back of the chair). 4. If you do a lot of sports, it‚Äôs best to take morning measurements in a sitting position. Sitting up after sleep, don‚Äôt forget to give your circulatory system several minutes to adjust before taking a measurement. When the algorithm forms your baseline, you‚Äôll see the relevant notification in your feed.

Not all it seems to be.
Keskillia
I originally paid 12 months upfront for the app because they showed on Twitter images of it being used on an Apple Watch. I couldn‚Äôt get it on my watch and their support said the pictures they used were just to get attention but not available on the watch. They give repetitive hints to lower blood pressure such as consume more dairy products which is not a good thing to do to lower blood pressure. I gave three stars because the one good thing on the app is the heart rate variability measurement.

Selling data and other concerns
Ajeburrah
I‚Äôd always felt uncomfortable allowing this app to access my health data. Because according to their data policy - which yes, i read - they sell this information to Facebook for advertising purposes. So even if your account is ‚Äúfree‚Äù you are paying a priceless amount in the form of data. It makes me feel uncomfortable. However, their decision to remove the table that showed HRV, SDNN, etc in favor of some ugly looking cups that repeat the same information on the timeline was the final goodbye i needed. I‚Äôm not sure why they would remove a genuinely efficient and useful feature. In favor of‚Ä¶.cups? Lol I‚Äôve deleted my data. Thanks and goodbye

A scam, nothing more
Tpamusician813
This app is an absolute scam - one minute my ‚Äústress‚Äù is at 99% and I‚Äôm on the verge of a heart attack and 1 hour later it‚Äôs at 30%. These results are far from accurate and meant to scare and frighten the end user instead of being helpful. According to this app, I‚Äôm on the verge of death, but according to my doctor I‚Äôm in great health. These developers should be ashamed of themselves for introducing what is essentially snake oil masquerading as a health insights app to the App Store. This app is getting deleted from my phone and I suggest you do the same.
10 December, 2022 at 8:01 PM
Hello there. Thank you for the feedback. Your back-to-back measurements usually show different results for two reasons: there has been a change in either the measurement accuracy (the higher the measurement quality ‚Äî the more accurate the results) or your emotional/physical state. Heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Processes in your body never stop: food digestion, hormone production, vascular tone control. That‚Äôs why back-to-back measurements can sometimes show slightly different results. However, larger differences can also happen ‚Äî usually in the situations described below: 1. You take back-to-back measurements after moving around for a while. 2. There are shifts in your sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. 3. You take back-to-back measurements right after waking up. 4. You were standing or sitting in an uncomfortable position during the measurement. 5. You checked your Facebook page, had a phone call, etc., during or between back-to-back measurements. You can read more about it here: https://help.welltory.com/en/articles/4253039. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good; it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, a ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress and didn‚Äôt recover yet - most often, it‚Äôs either overworking or working out too much.

I have been searching for an app to better watch what is happening with my heart. I‚Äôve used the app for a few weeks to get the hang of the ratings and was about to purchase a full subscription. I liked the data view where I could see the individual ratings. It allowed me to easily see some trends if my breathing helped or if a stressful event was handled ok. This new journal view is awful and doesn‚Äôt allow you to see anything specific. Please give us an option to turn this new view off. I regret updating.

this app creates stress rather that helping, due to a confused user interface, confusing messages, non accurate measurements. i cannot understand how this is a highly rated app. the6 charged a year in advance and i contacted apple for a refund after 48 hours of confusion
02 December, 2022 at 3:55 AM
Hi there! We're sorry to hear that the app is stressing you. Please note that heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is really experiencing at the moment. You can feel different from what your body is actually experiencing. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. As per the subscription ‚Äî it's a standard Apple subscription type, if you confirm it, you purchase it. Please contact us via in-app chat if you need any help with the refund.

This is the most negative, depressing health app I‚Äôve ever seen. It basically flares in your face that you‚Äôre unhealthy, overdressed and adds red death swirls everywhere to emphasize. Strange that other apps can cover data with encouragement and this one simply tries to drag you down more and add to your stress. Additionally, the data is poorly presented and doesn‚Äôt offer any context or ways to improve. Do not recommend.
23 November, 2022 at 3:01 AM
Hello! First of all, thank you for your honest feedback. We appreciate it and have passed it on to our team. Secondly, we are sincerely sorry that the app made you feel this way. It's never our intention to scare you or make you anxious ‚Äî we only want you to pay close attention to what your nervous system is experiencing, as it's the key to your wellness. It's normal to have anxiety over bad measurements - some people struggle with acknowledging that, for example, 5 hours of sleep really does affect their state. It's hard for us to accept that our bodies might be experiencing stress without us knowing. But then again, we believe you can only improve what you can measure. It's one thing to know that you're supposed to sleep at least 7 hours a day, and it's a whole other thing to clearly see the data on how your body is doing when it gets enough time to recover.

This App Had So MUCH Potential
krittylu
I downloaded the app and participated in ty he free trial. During the trial, things were awesome.the app uodated my health info, provided it to me with meaningful commentary and it did this every four hours. I did approach the dev regarding being a potential beta tester buy was turned down. But with the way I was getting such great information, I decided to pull the trigger on this VERY expensive app. Practically as soon as I hiy the subscribe button to buy all of the premium features, they went away and or became harder to access. I reached out to dev andntheybgave a step by step on how to "fix"this. But it didn't. I'm now getting non meaningful measurements only one time a day that are not particularly relevant as the measurements are HOURS old before they are presented to the user with recommendations. Anyway, don't buy this app. It is much to expensive for what you get. And the fact that I KNOW the app is capable of more but quit the premium performance after I subscribed really p*sses me off. My money, my loss. I FAFO.üòñ

19 November, 2022 at 8:56 PM
Hello there. Thank you for leaving your feedback. But the Welltory app is more complicated: our approach is based on decades of scientific research. Welltory analyzes heart rate variability (HRV) ‚Äî a health marker backed by over 25,000 studies on PubMed. Heart rate variability is a trusted health assessment method. First designed to track astronaut performance in the 1960s, HRV analysis quickly gained a reputation as a reliable health assessment method applicable to fields like healthcare, high-performance sports, and military training. Today, HRV is used by researchers, healthcare professionals, and pro athletes to track stress, recovery, systemic inflammation, and overall nervous system balance. Recent research (April 2022) proved that Welltory is a valid and reliable smartphone application and can be used to monitor HRV in elite endurance athletes: https://welltory.com/science.

Welltory Stress, accuracy..?.?..
Djoe314
Application Application Always says that I‚Äôm Highly stressed out, even when I feel as if I‚Äôm absolutely not. So, I‚Äôm not sure how accurate the app, is.
19 November, 2022 at 4:48 AM
Hello there. Thank you for sharing your feedback! Welltory measures your physiological stress, meaning how your body reacts to any unusual and potentially dangerous situation.| What you feel may coincide with what your body‚Äôs experiencing. For example, when we‚Äôre sick, we‚Äôre feeling awful, AND our bodies are weak and need rest. But our feelings may not always reflect what our bodies are going through. Like when we‚Äôre on vacation and feeling great ‚Äî but the measurements show high stress levels. Why‚Äôs that? It could potentially be chronic stress that can‚Äôt be fixed within two weeks at the seaside hotel. It could also be that the rest you‚Äôre getting isn‚Äôt suitable for you. This is where self-tracking helps ‚Äî you can see the data that tells you, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not resting, you need to relax,' ‚Äî which might lead you to pay more attention to your body and get the rest it actually needs.

Absolutely confusing
PJRug
One metric says im under stress the other says no. Yet another says stress and a fourth relaxed‚Ä¶.The sleep analysis is way off. Says i got a great nights sleep last night. 7.5 hours! I wasnt even in bed for 6 hours. Confounded by this app and Im a medical professional.
17 November, 2022 at 10:41 AM
Hi there. The thing is that the chart message metrics are very general. They don‚Äôt take into account your physiological characteristics or lifestyle. And they are calculated independently of one another. As a result, they can sometimes contradict each other, misalign with the Stress, Energy, and Health scores, or fail to reflect how you feel. We recommend that you pay more attention to the big picture, i.e. Stress, Energy, and Health scores, and the changes in your numbers over time, rather than isolated metrics from a particular chart message. As for the issue with your sleep analysis, we take your sleep data from Apple Health. If you can see any data mismatch, please send us a bug report and screenshots from Apple Health. For that, go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, attach screenshots, and tap Upload.

So far I believe‚Ä¶..
SEmmett22
I believe the app mostly, because it‚Äôs reflecting how I feel most of the time. But I‚Äôm not 100% on all the data it gives, just when the colored liquid starts flowing, I know red is bad and green is good Etc‚Ä¶ and a few of the insights. I haven‚Äôt sprung for the premium plan yet, because it‚Äôs kind of expensive for me at least, to spend on something I‚Äôm not 100% clear about in the first place. I think it‚Äôs obvious my heart rate would be effected by stress etc‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs also accurate if I‚Äôm worried or something is bothering me that I‚Äôm not stressing about but still.. I also take anxiety medication so I‚Äôm concerned wether that gives a false or a more accurate reading. I‚Äôm anxious to see what happens when I‚Äôm put back on my blood pressure medication in a few days.. I will update after that. So far I give it a 3-3.5

It was fun at the beginning, I wanted to purchase full version, than I noticed burning pain in my finger while holding up on camera lenses , not sure why , you my want to check this out !
13 November, 2022 at 2:32 AM
Hi! We're sorry for the unpleasant experience! You can change the brightness of the flashlight on your device: 1. On an iPhone with Face ID, swipe down from the upper-right corner to open Control Center. Or, on an iPhone with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom edge of the screen to open Control Center. 2. Press and hold the Flashlight button. 3. Drag the slider up or down. Also, we can recommend you keep your finger 1-2 mm away from a flashlight, lay just the tip of the finger on the flash, or cover the flash with half of the fingertip. That may be enough to light your finger for measurement.

Waste of money JUNK JUNK JUNK
Mikki 2323 L
This app is not at ALL worth $2.00 let alone $79.99. It‚Äôs very inconsistent with the data and takes forever to load new info when my other apps are much faster. This week it‚Äôs telling me not to exercise because I did to much last week, but that‚Äôs not true. Sometimes it will track my sleep and other times it won‚Äôt. I purchased it by mistake, but thought since I had it that I would at least try it. When I realized it was junk and reached out to tell them and request a refund they refused to work with me and gave me the run around. Since I‚Äôm forced to keep it I‚Äôd like for it to at LEAST be of SOME value and it‚Äôs not- it‚Äôs junk. Don‚Äôt waste your money. You would be better off donating 80$ to a shelter whereas at least then you would feel good about where your money went instead of knowing that you got taken LIKE I did by purchasing this garbage. It‚Äôs junk-100% pure junk. I‚Äôm normally not this negative but I hope if you read this then I can save you $80 because once you spend it here you are stuck with it. Their customer service will give you nonsense replies that make about as much sense as this app does when you reach out with questions about it. If I could give it a negative 5 review I would. Good luck and DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS. 1 more thing- this thing will tell me I have high blood pressure yet the app that goes with the bp monitor I bought says I don‚Äôt and so does my doctor. Smh

Almost there on Accuracy
JoeyRonz22
It‚Äôs a great app overall. The one glitch I notice is that the accuracy can be confused between energy and health. For example, yesterday I was sick and it had my energy at 40% and my health at 100%.
11 November, 2022 at 8:01 AM
Hi there, and thanks for leaving your feedback. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Ôªø Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. Health is your body‚Äôs ability to maintain homeostasis regardless of what may be happening to you. This metric is important to monitor when you‚Äôre sick, because it shows how well your body is coping. A high level of health means you‚Äôre doing alright, even if you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms, while a low one is a sign the illness is taking a toll on you. Energy reflects your body‚Äôs ability to support processes like metabolism, movement, and digestion, as well as to recover properly. Energy level determines how well you can maintain a stable internal environment, or homeostasis, and perform physical activity.

Love app, hard to understand
dtmcmf
I love the stress monitor on this app as it is super insightful! I find the rest of it cluttered and confusing to understand the different metrics. I know there are links to read up on HOW the reads work in general, but I want to know specifically for MY rates what it shows. More personalization would be nice. Kind of like the FitBit app- I found there‚Äôs to be more clear and h sees good my heart rates. AppleHealth also isn‚Äôt that great either to understand. Will keep this for the stress monitor aspect.

07 November, 2022 at 11:38 PM
Hi there! Thank you for the feedback; we appreciate it. It's okay to feel different from the measurement result ‚Äî heart rate variability (HRV) doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what is happening to you and what your body is experiencing at the moment. This is exactly why HRV measurements are helpful. About the sleep analysis: this is also not always obvious. Sometimes it seems that you slept well, but the indicators say otherwise ‚Äî this is an opportunity to learn more about yourself and to experiment by following the advice from the recommendations. Also, it's not necessary to take a measurement right after you wake up. You can use the bathroom or drink some water, too, but to take the most accurate morning measurement, we recommend you to lie down or sit down for 10‚Äì15 minutes before doing it. You can read more about it in this article: https://help.welltory.com/articles/3361520. Hope that helps. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact us via in-app chat (Menu ‚Üí Help & Support ‚Üí chat icon). We're always there and happy to help.

Disappointing ‚ÄúFree Trial‚Äù
DuckStorm
Welltory is quite expensive and they invest heavily on advertising the product. But when it comes to actually test driving the pro features the feee trial experience leaves much to be desired. It starts as soon as you install even if you don‚Äôt open the app. I went to try it a few weeks later and found I couldn‚Äôt explore any of the features. I am not willing to invest so much on an unproven product. I reached out to customer support and they confirmed the customer support is sorely lacking. It is sad to see a company that invests so heavily not believe in their product enough to let the product sell itself. If the company doesn‚Äôt believe in your products ability to sell itself why should anyone else? And if the company doesn‚Äôt empower your customer support to fix problems, why would anyone trust the company?

Unfortunately, at the moment, we do not have all-features free trial periods. Perhaps in the future, we will have more opportunities to try Welltory.

Stressed all the time?

Whenever the app measures my stress level (even when I am asleep) the results are - I‚Äôm extremely stressed, I need rest and might be ill. All of these results are wrong. I can‚Äôt trust results like that!
06 November, 2022 at 9:07 AM
Hi there, and thanks for leaving your feedback. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Ôªø Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good, it's a degree of tension in the body's regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, "good" stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can't respond adequately to any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, then your body is under too much tension, and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress, and didn't recover yet - most often it's either overworking, or working out too much. If you experience any issues with the app, please send us a bug report. We'll need it to look into the problem.

Maybe this works for some people but for me it‚Äôs a total crock. Within hours it will switch from telling me I‚Äôm under 98% stress (with a stress inducing red wave) and to take a nap to saying I‚Äôm 40% and I should go work out. I feel the same. It gives you advice like clean your bedroom to sleep better (not the problem‚Ä¶). It‚Äôs a real waste of $ just use health on your phone and read generic wellness articles to get the free equivalent of this program
05 November, 2022 at 5:01 PM
Hi there, and thank you for your review. Your feedback is important to us and we‚Äôre sorry to hear you‚Äôve had such a frustrating experience. The thing is that heart rate variability is highly sensitive to even the slightest changes, including both external factors and adjustments happening inside your body. Even back-to-back measurements taken in a couple of minutes can change drastically. Moreover, it's very important to check the measurement accuracy. If you experience any issues with the app, please send us a bug report. We'll need it to look into the problem.

Measurements WAY off
refinch
I‚Äôve been comparing this to two other apps and the way I feel. It‚Äôs consistently off on my stress (high after meditation) other apps catch it immediately. The other measurements usually make no sense based on how I feel & BP. I keep seeing ads for a watch view. There is no such thing. I wasted $80 because of the high ratings. Canceled!
01 November, 2022 at 4:57 AM
Hello there. Thank you for sharing your feedback. We appreciate it and are sorry that you weren't satisfied with Welltory. If we compare HRV indicators between apps, then for a correct comparison, it is necessary to use the same RR-intervals since even measurements taken in parallel by different applications will give different results. In this case, the degree of difference will depend on the calculation algorithms. Different devices and apps pick up the signal differently. If you take measurements with a camera, it is incorrect to compare the results. You can find out why here: https://medium.com/welltory/camera-vs-polar-heart-rate-monitor-68902fb6a2d7. The gold standard for analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) is the Kubios software. It is used for medical purposes. Our frequency-domain scores (RMSSD, SDNN, AMo, pNN50) completely match the Kubios result. We checked it many times. You can check it yourself: 1. Open the web version of our app 2. Export your RR intervals 3. Download Kubios and run the calculation Kubios is free for personal purposes. If you still want to compare the results, it is better to use a Bluetooth heart monitor and take measurements of 300 RR intervals. In contrast, the spectral parameters (Total Power, LF, HF, VLF) can be compared only in parallel but not in sequential measurements. Spectral analysis shows in which direction the state of your body is changing at a particular moment. Considering that this state adjusts to events every millisecond, to the extent that it changes on inhalation and exhalation, when food moves through the intestines, etc., you should not evaluate the general state using the spectral. Spectral analysis is helpful for the following categories of users: 1. Those who take measurements strictly at the same time of day and in the same position and assess whether indicators have dropped. If they have decreased by 2-4 times and stay within these values for more than one morning, this is a sign of problems. 2. For those who conduct meditation or breathing practices understand that the practice gives exactly the effects that it should, and not vice versa. 3. That is, spectral analysis is like a second snapshot of a state. But the parameters from the main screen (Stress, Productivity, Energy) are more reliable for assessing within the day. Also, there are no ads in the app. Welltory relies on a safe, straightforward business model where you pay us to process your data on a secure server.

Disappointing
Fudgewart
The review of systems can be very late. Today (oct 31) the latest heart rate data was for 10/19. Also, it would be helpful and easy to report vagal tone, but welltory doesn‚Äôt.
31 October, 2022 at 10:28 PM
Hello there! Firstly, please send us a bug report ‚Äî we'll need it to look into the problem. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem, briefly describe your issue, and send your report. Also, some screenshots will be helpful. We'll investigate and help you sort it out if there is an issue. Thanks! Secondly ‚Äî you can specify all your medical conditions in the Do you have any health risks? self-test. To find it, please, go to Menu ‚Üí Self-tests. All of them will be taken into account after that. We also recommend completing other health-related self-tests. Please note that both your meds affect the heart rate and, therefore, can influence the HRV results. We recommend measuring an hour after taking them to minimize their influence on measurement results. Plus, you can mark them in your feed with tags ‚Äî this will make tracking the time easier.

I purchased a 1 year subscription. It worked well in the beginning and now is not able to accurately track my sleep. It says I am sleeping like 3 hours a night which is incorrect. I don‚Äôt believe the app is accurate as it will send me a notification that I‚Äôm super stressed out when when I am not. Definitely not going to renew the subscription. Sad, I really wanted to like this, but it does not report accurately.

It doesn‚Äôt matter that I turned off notifications, it still nags me on phone and watch multiple times a day.

The constant spamming and pop-ups begging to subscribe made this app entirely worthless, negating the whole ‚Äòtrial period‚Äô concept.

Terrible Customer support!
1harleyman2
I purchase health apps to help understand my health and be able to make improvements! I saw Welltory and thought it would work out well. I was doing a monthly subscription with no issues! I had a question regarding what I was seeing in advertisements the app has a different look then I was seeing? I asked why my app didn‚Äôt look like that? Their response was quick and exact. I was told that were future updates and to keep a look out for the new and exciting update! Shortly after that I seen an option for a life long membership for $195.00 dollars which at the time seemed to be a good offer! Huge mistake!!! If you are looking to buy an app for your health, look elsewhere! Shortly after purchasing my lifetime membership, I had an issue. I reached out to Welltory support with screenshots and a short explanation of my issue. I received my response that was a generic cut and paste response! Nothing at all to do with my problem!!! I reached out again to their support and received a little different response from another support person? I was upset that I never had any issues as a monthly customer, when I became a lifetime customer with no money back guarantee, my first issue that I had seemed unacceptable! After multiple emails, they then wanted logs? I didn‚Äôt buy this app to feel like I was the joke! With my emails to support, I explained I know apps have issues, logs help‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fine, initially I didn‚Äôt receive that! Since I didn‚Äôt feel that my best interests were a priority all I wanted to do now was to receive my lifetime membership fee refunded. Since they have your money, and there is a NO refund policy, even if it‚Äôs not working correctly? If anybody is looking for a health app, look elsewhere!!! It‚Äôs not great experience when a customer pays $195.00 for a lifetime membership and doesn‚Äôt use the app, terrible job Welltory!!! Rick

Good information. Notifications not frequent.
Purvesh desai
The app has a lot of detailed info. However the notifications are slow to come in. It does not measure heart rate all the time I guess. My stress level at 11 when the notification came in is different from 3 pm and no notifications then. It should be at least hourly.
27 October, 2022 at 10:44 PM
Hi there. Thanks for the feedback! If you're talking about automatic measurements, the thing is that your Apple Watch decides itself when to take a measurement. You have to be calm at that time and not asleep, not moving, and your heart rate isn't too high. Unfortunately, this option is controlled by Apple Watch, not by Welltory. ÔªøBut you can take a manual measurement at any convenient time. If you experience any issues with notifications, please send us a bug report. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem. briefly describe your issue, and send us a report.

It is either reporting that everyone is stressed inaccurately, or it just reports that you are to get you to pay for the subscription (reminds me of Dianetics where they convince you that you are depressed so you need them to fix you). Be wiser, don‚Äôt fall for the traps.
26 October, 2022 at 9:50 PM
Hi there, thanks for the review! Please note that we measure physical rather than emotional stress. They may impact one another, but they‚Äôre not the same. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to keep tabs on physical stress: what you feel may not coincide with what your body is actually experiencing. When you‚Äôre not in touch with your body, you risk overdoing it and may end up with chronic stress or other health problems. However, if you see that your measurement results are not correct, please send us a bug report to check if everything is calculated correctly in your algorithms. To send a bug report from the app, go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem. Thank you!

Don‚Äôt use if anxious
The Truth1027
Edit for developers comment: Great dodge of the only thing I shed a light on. Why do you put so much on HRV when you should know it‚Äôs very personal to each individual? Or do you truly stand by your questionnaire? This app will ruin your life and give you massive cardiophobia if you let it. I bought a year because that‚Äôs all they offer and already deleted because it literally ruined my life. I was happy and healthy and I became an emotional wreck constantly checking vitals and HRV. HRV is extremely personal to the individual and it seems weird to base your entire system on it without any personal information besides a vanilla questionnaire. Delete if you‚Äôre having problems, don‚Äôt let it continue.
23 October, 2022 at 5:45 PM
Hello there. We're sorry to hear that we've affected your life so badly! Our approach is based on decades of scientific research. Welltory analyzes heart rate variability (HRV) ‚Äî a health marker backed by over 25,000 studies on PubMed. Heat rate variability is a trusted health assessment method. First designed to track astronaut performance in the 1960s, HRV analysis quickly gained a reputation as a reliable health assessment method applicable to fields like healthcare, high-performance sports, and military training. Today, HRV is used by researchers, healthcare professionals, and pro athletes to track stress, recovery, systemic inflammation, and overall nervous system balance. Please note that when you start using Welltory, it‚Äôs also important to train the self-learning algorithm, so that it can form your baseline. Regular morning measurements will do the job. They will help the algorithm understand your usual nervous system‚Äôs state before the effect of a breakfast, cigarette, coffee, or workout. If you experience any issues with the app, please send us a bug report. Go to Menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Report a problem. briefly describe your issue, and send us a report.

Deceptive billing practices
heartwork means honesty
The company doesn‚Äôt allow for paying monthly. They did allow it in the past but changed it. They don‚Äôt even allow it now except on their website on some secret place. Businesses that sell products and hijack you through their subscriptions are deceptive and no matter how good or bad their product is deceptive business practices must go. A similar deception as someone whose omits the truth. They just hope you don‚Äôt notice. Products that operate financially this way are not something my heart aligns with. Deception with a heart product? Taking great ideas and letting big corporate accountants is why all our inventions are souring.
23 October, 2022 at 3:55 PM
Hi, and thank you for your interest in our product. Kindly note that payments both from within the app and on our official website are completely safe.

You need to buy a subscription for data recording. $6.99 a month or $79.99 annual.

I don‚Äôt like giving negative reviews but this app is now causing me stress! It has continually given readings that I am burning the candles at both ends, am nearly 100% in stress and so on; even when my body is in a state of calm and my heart rate low. While I do have episodes of stress, I don‚Äôt believe this is continual even when totally relaxed/first thing in the morning/ doing things I like. It now is actually causing me anxiety because of such high readings. Something here is vastly wrong. My resting heart rate is low 60s so to say my body is continually stressed and I‚Äôm pushing myself is incorrect. I can‚Äôt see myself continuing to use this app with the constant notifications telling me how I need to calm down or rest etc; it is actually now causing me stress even when relaxed.
21 October, 2022 at 10:54 AM
Hello there. Firstly, we're grateful for your feedback and genuinely appreciate it. Secondly, we're really sorry that the app made you feel stressed or anxious. It was never our intention. The way you feel may sometimes differ from how your body is actually doing at the moment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs ok. Heart rate variability doesn‚Äôt reflect your mood or emotional state. It shows how your heart and nervous system react to what‚Äôs happening to you. There are many things that can affect your state: from illnesses and positive or negative events in your life to caffeine, nicotine, etc. That‚Äôs why sometimes you may feel energized when in reality, you need a break or find yourself drained while the energy is still there. That‚Äôs when your heart rate variability analysis is most helpful ‚Äî it shows you what your body is really experiencing at the moment. Also, high stress is not necessarily something bad, and low stress is not necessarily something good; it‚Äôs a degree of tension in the body‚Äôs regulatory systems. Those systems can regulate how your body works, depending on the situation. Therefore, a ‚Äúgood‚Äù stress level is something in the middle. If the stress is very low, it means that your stress-implementing systems do not work, and your body can‚Äôt respond adequately to any threats or stress factors that you have to face. If the stress is high, your body is under too much tension and cannot cope with the stress factors. This could happen if you were under a lot of stress and didn‚Äôt recover yet ‚Äî most often, it‚Äôs either overworking or working out too much. Hope you will find this information helpful. Kindly let us know if you have any more questions.

Skeptical about the technical Design
dnorton728
Be careful of what email you use to sign up with. I have Apple‚Äôs private relay turned on. When I subscribed using my Apple ID, it actually created the account using the randomly generated private relay email address. The app developer said the email you sign up with is the key I‚Äôd they use and it cannot be changed. Makes me wonder about what other technical blunders are in the app.
20 October, 2022 at 7:13 PM
Hello. Thank you for the feedback. It's not a bug ‚Äî we really cannot change your Welltory email as it is a unique user identifier in our system. ÔªøWhen our users log in with Apple Sign-in and choose to hide the real Apple ID email in their iPhone settings, Apple auto-generates for them an encrypted Apple ID email. So your email is just hidden and safe. This is Apple's technology unrelated to Welltory at all. You can set it up for receiving incoming emails in your iPhone settings. Read more here: https://support.apple.com/HT210425. ÔªøAlso, you can check your actual email address for forwarded emails this way: 1. go to Settings ‚Äî tap your profile above ‚Äî tap Password & Security, 2. tap Apps Using Apple ID ‚Äî Welltory ‚Äî Manage Settings, 3. check Forward To option to be sure which email address you use for forwarding.

Jeden Morgen Negativ Suggestionen

Habe die App nach wenigen Tagen wieder gel√∂scht, nachdem sie mir jeden Morgen mitgeteilt hat, dass ich entweder schwer krank sei, oder in K√ºrze schwer krank werden w√ºrde. Dabei erfreue ich mich bester Gesundheit! Auf solche be√§ngstigenden t√§glichen Negativ-Suggestionen kann ich verzichten.
20 October, 2022 at 12:15 PM
Hallo! Zun√§chst einmal sind wir Ihnen f√ºr Ihr Feedback dankbar und wissen es wirklich zu sch√§tzen. Zweitens bedauern wir sehr, dass Sie die Empfehlungen der App so empfinden. Es war nie unsere Absicht. Wenn Sie einige spezifische Beispiele f√ºr die Nachrichten haben, die Sie negativ finden, teilen Sie sie uns bitte mit. Gerne leiten wir Ihr Feedback an unser Team weiter. Die Art und Weise, wie Sie sich f√ºhlen, kann sich manchmal von der tats√§chlichen Verfassung Ihres K√∂rpers unterscheiden ‚Äì und das ist in Ordnung. Die Herzfrequenzvariabilit√§t spiegelt nicht Ihre Stimmung oder Ihren emotionalen Zustand wider. Es zeigt, wie Ihr Herz und Ihr Nervensystem auf das reagieren, was mit Ihnen passiert. Es gibt viele Dinge, die Ihren Zustand beeinflussen k√∂nnen: von Krankheiten und positiven oder negativen Ereignissen in Ihrem Leben bis hin zu Koffein, Nikotin usw. Deshalb f√ºhlen Sie sich manchmal energiegeladen, obwohl Sie in Wirklichkeit eine Pause brauchen, oder f√ºhlen sich ersch√∂pft, w√§hrend die Energie vorhanden ist noch da. Dann ist Ihre Herzfrequenz-Variabilit√§tsanalyse am hilfreichsten ‚Äì sie zeigt Ihnen, was Ihr K√∂rper gerade wirklich erlebt. Au√üerdem ist hoher Stress nicht unbedingt etwas Schlechtes und niedriger Stress ist nicht unbedingt etwas Gutes; Es ist ein gewisses Ma√ü an Spannung in den Regulationssystemen des K√∂rpers. Diese Systeme k√∂nnen je nach Situation regulieren, wie Ihr K√∂rper funktioniert. Daher ist ein ‚Äûguter‚Äú Stresslevel etwas in der Mitte. Wenn der Stress sehr gering ist, bedeutet dies, dass Ihre stressimplementierenden Systeme nicht funktionieren und Ihr K√∂rper nicht angemessen auf Bedrohungen oder Stressfaktoren reagieren kann, denen Sie sich stellen m√ºssen. Ist der Stress hoch, steht Ihr K√∂rper unter zu gro√üer Anspannung und kann die Stressfaktoren nicht bew√§ltigen. Dies k√∂nnte passieren, wenn Sie unter viel Stress standen und sich noch nicht erholt haben ‚Äì meistens ist es entweder √úberarbeitung oder zu viel Training. Ich hoffe, Sie finden diese Informationen hilfreich. Bitte teilen Sie uns mit, wenn Sie weitere Fragen haben.

Hello! Thank you for sharing your feedback. We apologize for any confusion caused by the wording in our app description. The app does not measure blood pressure directly as it requires specialized equipment. However, it does allow users to log and track their blood pressure readings manually, which can be helpful for monitoring and managing their health over time. Thank you for your input.

Volevo provare questa app per misurazione della pressione con la prova gratuita come √® scritto nella presentazione. Invece mi avete scalato subito i 49,90. Ho annullato subito l‚Äôabbonamento e chiesto il rimborso. La risposta: non si pu√≤ rimborsare. Trovo molto ingannevole. Fra l‚Äôaltro non funziona. Per misurare la pressione ci vuole sempre un apparecchio. Il cuore lo misura benissimo con l‚Äôapplewatch. Sconsiglio l‚Äôacquisto. .

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Kindly note that our app is based on contact photoplethysmography. You may find this information in the FAQ section of the application. The algorithm detects variations of light absorption caused by arterial blood-volume pulsations. However, this method may result in inaccurate readings if you try to measure the light on non-living objects. Just drop us an email at support@aiby.com if you require any assistance. We will be happy to help you.

Wild false advertising, and unscientific
Mollusk3087
So, I saw an ad on a social media app (the one that has the name relating to a clock), and saw an ad for an app that can measure my blood oxygen level, and my heart rate. I knew that this made no sense, but I wanted to check out how bogus it was. Of course, it immediately needed payment info, hoping I would forget about in when the free trial ran out. And just because I wanted to see how accurate it was, I measured my BPM (it said 26, I‚Äôm at 90), then I tried a bag of chips, and it read 123, and said I had ‚Äúlow energy levels‚Äù, after these tests it wanted access to my health app (never allow applications like this have access to you info, their selling it). I can also see that the creators are obviously botting their reviews, and deleting real ones. Also, their little ad campaign of ‚Äúthis app is saving thousands of lives a year‚Äù is so scummy. Whoever made this app is honestly an awful person. Sure, we all need to get some cash, even if it may be in a morally questionable way, but this is just overkill. Boring reviews, pushing lies in your ads, and taking advantage of people who aren‚Äôt tech savvy, and immediately asking for payment info (which I haven‚Äôt actually found a way to cancel payment)
17 September, 2023 at 5:06 AM
Hello! We're sorry to hear about your concerns and want to assure you that we take user feedback seriously and are committed to providing a positive experience for our users. Firstly, regarding privacy concerns, we do not sell or use users' information outside of the app itself. We understand the importance of user privacy and adhere to strict guidelines to protect it. Secondly, while we offer a subscription with additional features, our app can be used for free with certain limitations. We do promote the subscription within the app, but it's not mandatory to enjoy the basic functionalities. In terms of reviews, it's important to note that developers do not have the authority to delete reviews unilaterally. Apple strictly regulates the reviews section, and any deletion or modification requires confirmation from Apple. We encourage honest and constructive feedback, and we're always working to address concerns and improve the app. If you are having trouble canceling your subscription, I recommend reaching out to our support team for assistance at support@aiby.com. They can guide you through the cancellation process and ensure that your subscription is canceled as per your request.

This app is not true at all. If you are using this app for actually heart rate monitoring your gonna get hurt. This app says that it will, ‚ÄúMonitor your heart rate and blood pressure.‚Äù That is plain untrue. It‚Äôs horrible that your using this as a way to take advantage of people who don‚Äôt know any better. Inanimate objects do not have a heart beat nor stress and blood pressure.

False Advertising
ashianataeeee
Not exactly sure how they have nearly 5 stars when IPhone‚Äôs health app does exactly what this app does and more. Thankfully, I skimmed through reviews before opening the app. The developer has stated that the app has never been said to DIRECTLY measure blood pressure, but that‚Äôs a lie seeing as though I was sent here from Instagram based on an AD that shows someone putting their finger on the camera lens to measure stress levels, heart rate, mood, and energy along with a video insinuating that it measures blood pressure. Definitely click bait/false advertising. But if you‚Äôd like to jot down your BP after taking it with a machine, this app is for you!

BUYER BEWARE!
Outraged631
This app DOES NOT monitor blood pressure directly. My wife‚Äôs first language is not English and she purchased this app that says ‚Äúmonitors blood pressure‚Äù to‚Ä¶well, to monitor her blood pressure! So, in this instance, it depends on the meaning of the word ‚Äòmonitor.‚Äô For this type of monitor, you could simply take your blood pressure and write it down in a notebook as opposed to being scammed into a $40 recurring subscription. I see in other reviews how the developer responds by saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll review the language in our description‚Ä¶ blah blah blah‚Äù when they could simply post a disclaimer (as many similar apps do) stating: this app does not read blood pressure directly. Period. If you do mistakenly purchase this app, you need to go to your subscriptions and immediately cancel it, otherwise next year will roll around and you‚Äôll be scammed once again.

Download ‚ÄúHeartRate‚Äù instead
angrytravel1
This app promotes paranoia. I have two apps on my phone. This one claims my heart is beating at 120 beats per minute. HeartRate says 70. I have fully been sent into a panic attack from this for fear of heart failure. If it gives you an outrageous number and you don‚Äôt physically feel a difference don‚Äôt believe it. If your heart rate goes up after the fact it‚Äôs most likely due to anxiety. Don‚Äôt believe this and don‚Äôt rely on it for valuable health information. Place a finger on your wrist, set a stopwatch. Count your pulse for ten seconds and multiply by six, and there‚Äôs your BPM acoustic style. Zero stars. Shame on you.
10 August, 2023 at 12:16 AM
Hello! We're sorry to hear that you encountered some inconsistencies in the heart rate readings. The app's accuracy relies on various factors, including the steadiness of your finger while placing it on the camera lens, lighting conditions, and other environmental variables. Holding your breath or making sudden movements during the measurement might affect the readings. We are continuously working to improve the app's accuracy and performance. Your feedback is valuable to us, and we'll take your comments into consideration as we make updates. If you have any further questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@aiby.com. We're here to assist you and enhance your experience with the app

Disappointed with Inpulse Premium's Free Trial Promise
Rideop20carol
I recently decided to give Inpulse Premium a try after hearing about their impressive features and benefits. However, I must express my disappointment with the lack of transparency regarding their free trial offer. When I first stumbled upon their website, I was excited to see that they were offering a free trial period. This feature was prominently advertised as a great opportunity to explore their premium services without any financial commitment. It seemed like the perfect chance for me to determine whether Inpulse Premium was a good fit for my needs. However, upon signing up, I quickly discovered that no free trial was actually provided. Instead, I was immediately prompted to input my billing details and charged for a full subscription without even having an opportunity to try their services. The lack of transparency and follow-through on their free trial promise disappointed me greatly. Inpulse Premium should be more forthright with their customers, clearly communicating that a free trial is not available before requesting payment details. By not offering the trial they initially advertised, it feels a lot like a bait-and-switch tactic, where potential customers are enticed with a promise that is not fulfilled. Moreover, the lack of an option to request a refund adds to my frustration. After realizing that there was no free trial, I reached out to their customer support, only to be met with unsatisfactory responses and no willingness to address the issue. It's disheartening to feel trapped into a subscription I did not intend to start. As a potential customer, I highly value honesty and integrity in the companies I choose to invest my time and money in. Inpulse Premium's failure to deliver on their free trial promise and their lack of willingness to rectify the situation has left me extremely dissatisfied. Despite Inpulse Premium's claims of exceptional services, their deceptive practices and poor customer service overshadow any potential benefits. I would caution others to be wary of their advertised free trial and be prepared for unexpected charges right from the start. In conclusion, I regretfully advise against subscribing to Inpulse Premium, as their failure to provide a promised free trial and handle customer issues appropriately has left me with a sour experience.

Hello! We apologize for any inconvenience and disappointment you experienced with our free trial offer. We always strive for transparency and want to ensure our customers are well-informed about our subscription conditions. Please note that we offer several subscription plans, and not all of them come with a free trial. It's possible that you may have selected a plan that doesn't provide this feature. Regarding the concern about charging users immediately after starting a free trial, we want to assure you that such a practice is impossible. Apple strictly regulates the billing process and reviews every app before its release on the App Store to ensure fair practices. Regarding the refund request issue, we regret any frustration you encountered when trying to address it with our customer support. However, it's important to note that all refunds are handled directly by Apple, so reaching out to their customer support would be the appropriate step. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience and negative experience you had with our app. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we are committed to improving our services to provide a better experience for all our users. If you have any further concerns or if there's anything else we can do for you, please don't hesitate to contact us directly at support@aiby.com. We are here to help and address any issues you may have.

I downloaded and used this app for about a week. I woke one day not feeling right and used this app. Showed things to be somewhat normal for heart at 68 BPM. I was actually in atrial flutter with 155 BPM. Same info given while sitting ER room hooked to monitor an hour later. Removing app and canceling subscription.

I have been dealing with some health concerns, so I thought this app might ease my mind. It did the opposite. My pulse reads normal, but it gives me an incredibly low score for everything else. I was worried that I am at death‚Äôs door because of this app. I decided to ask my husband to try it. His score was as bad as mine. So we are either both at deaths door or it‚Äôs full of crap.

Hello! Thank you for your feedback and for sharing your experience with the app. Regarding the "health" score, we apologize for any confusion it may have caused.

We'll take your feedback into consideration as we continue to enhance and refine the app's features.

InPulse is useless
tlacuache22$$$$
In pulse is useless if you are trying to monitor your blood pressure. This app only measures your pulse and heart rate. You can easily check your pulse by counting your heart beats for 15 sec and multiply by 4. Choose another app that monitor your blood pressure. Please don‚Äôt waste your money in this app.
25 June, 2023 at 10:30 AM
Hello! Thank you for sharing your feedback. We apologize for any confusion caused by the wording in our app description. The app does not measure blood pressure directly as it requires specialized equipment. However, it does allow users to log and track their blood pressure readings manually, which can be helpful for monitoring and managing their health over time. Thank you for your input.

Accurate However‚Ä¶.
MakotheShark11
This monitor is scary accurate. I did 3 readings at different times over the course of 3 days. After using the app, I take my heart rate manually. It‚Äôs usually 1-3 beats off but pretty good for an app. The reason I give this app three stars is for the ‚Äúheart health‚Äù score it gives you after taking a reading. It has options to select whether this reading was taken after sleeping, while resting or during exercise. I took a reading immediately after exercising and my heart rate was obviously elevated‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the point of working out right? I told the app I had been working out and it still gave me a heart health score of 20/100. I feel this is inaccurate and they are purely basing this score off of how my heart rate was over the average. I think this feature should be removed or improved to reduce confusion and to avoid people freaking out for no reason.

Beware! Misleading advertising.
Donnan1313
They claim to be a heart rate and blood pressure monitor, but it doesn‚Äôt check blood pressure‚Ä¶it only records like a journal after you input the information. That isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù. I cancelled app within 24 hours and asked Inpulse for a refund, they told me to contact Apple, which I did to no avail so I appealed their decision and appeal was denied because I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúvalid ‚Äú reason. So scrutinize every word but most importantly read ALL the reviews before you purchase an app because you evidently don‚Äôt get your money back even if app doesn‚Äôt do what they advertised. Ad also stated just a small amount per month, but they charged the entire year up front. So for using it once and discovering it wasn‚Äôt what it said I paid $44. Thanks Inpulse and Apple.
16 June, 2023 at 6:37 AM
Hello! We apologize for any confusion or frustration you experienced with our app. We are sorry that the description may have led to some misunderstanding about the functionality of the blood pressure monitoring feature. Regarding the refund, as app developers, we do not have direct control over refund requests, and they are typically handled by the respective app store (in this case, Apple). We appreciate your feedback and will take it into consideration to improve the app's description and clarity.

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Kindly note that our app is based on contact photoplethysmography. You may find this information in the FAQ section of the application. The algorithm detects variations of light absorption caused by arterial blood-volume pulsations. However, this method may result in inaccurate readings if you try to measure the light on non-living objects. Just drop us an email at support@aiby.com if you require any assistance.

cool idea but unreliable
slaurelboomerang13
i love the idea for this app as i have severe anxiety and i‚Äôm constantly checking my pulse! i was very excited when i downloaded it today and i did a couple tests to see how reliable it is, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt seem to hold up. i took my pulse using this app and a pulse oximeter at the same time and while this app said my heart was going 135 bpm, the oximeter said it was going just under 70 bpm. definitely a cool idea for an app and will probably still use it every so often to try it out, but i would not solely rely on it for any medical data!!

literally at first i was like ‚Äúoh cool an app that can actually help me with my crippled self‚Äù and i thought it actually worked you know? cuz i‚Äôd be inside and my heart would be like 77 or something, then i‚Äôd go outside and run, and it would be way higher. so i was like ‚Äúwoah it must be real if it knows my heart is beating faster.‚Äù well i started experimenting more with the app, and my heart rate was completely normal, and it said i was at 150 SOMETHING. I was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äù so i got a red blanket and put my phone camera against it, and IT ACTUALLY STARTED MEASURING THE BLANKET SAYING IT WAS AT AN 86. LIKE IS IT JUST THROWING NUMBERS UP THERE WHEN IT SEES RED?! I WOULD ALSO BE LIKE EXTREMELY TIRED AND IT SOULD SAY FULL ENERGY BUT YOUR HEART IS OVERWORKED. LIKE WHAT?! Don‚Äôt waste your time or money with this. Literally making people pay for a dumb app that false advertises. it‚Äôs not worth it.

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Kindly note that our app is based on contact photoplethysmography. You may find this information in the FAQ section of the application. The algorithm detects variations of light absorption caused by arterial blood-volume pulsations. However, this method may result in inaccurate readings if you try to measure the light on non-living objects. Just drop us an email at support@aiby.com if you require any assistance. We will be happy to help you.

Then it wants to charge you $10/week. Not worth it my friends. Learn how to check your own Pulse, and buy a pulse oximetre from Amazon if you really want to know your SpO2 levels.

El pulso lo mide err√≥neamente, no tiene forma de medir el ox√≠geno con la c√°mara por lo que el oximetro es una mentira. Yo no tenia asociada tarjeta, y a diferencia del resto de apps, que cuando se termina la prueba gratuita al no tener tarjeta asociada se cancelan las suscripciones, esta app lo cargo a la cuenta, y no quieren dar respuesta. La opci√≥n de soporte es una mentira, por que te mandan un mail ya armado d√°ndote siempre la misma respuesta en modo autom√°tico sin ni siquiera leer lo que escribes! no contestan los mail ni los reclamos.

You can put it on any red area and it apparently has a heart rate I wanted to see if it actually worked. I put it on a blue blanket and it showed no heart rate then I put it on a red pillow and it showed my pillow had a heart rate.

Also man kann jede Menge Apps umsonst f√ºr die Heartrate haben. Wieso diese App nun schon Geld nimmt nur zum Ausprobieren ist mir ein R√§tsel. Auch wenn man den Blutdruck mit messen kann ( weiss ich aber nicht da ich die App direkt wieder gel√∂scht habe) rechtfertigt das noch nicht f√ºr ein Trial Geld zu verlangen. Von daher nur einen Stern

Everytime i check my heart rate i do exactly as the instructions say to do, I put my finger on the camera and it takes like 8-10 times to actually go through all the way. Ive even tried my wrist and both index fingers at multiple angles too. It just doesn't like to work. And it has read my heart rate wrong multiple times giving me anxiety.

Does not actually monitor blood pressure
j1mmie
The app states that it "monitors" your blood pressure. Which is a purposely vague statement. The app doesn't monitor your blood pressure. You may measure your own blood pressure physically (via a machine, a clinic, etc). Then you may choose to enter your data manually (which is error prone, but that's beside the point). Maybe the app tells you if the data is high or low or something? But that hardly constitutes "monitoring" in my book. Maybe I'm a sucker because obviously how can an app measure pressure. But I was impressed with the heart rate measuring feature and thought maybe there's some way to estimate it. Devs: use the words "allows you to track/journal/log your blood pressure" instead. Until then, 1 star, false advertising. Apple should reject them from the App Store.
13 April, 2023 at 4:29 PM
Hello! Thank you for sharing your feedback. We apologize for any confusion caused by the wording in our app description. The app does not measure blood pressure directly as it requires specialized equipment. However, it does allow users to log and track their blood pressure readings manually, which can be helpful for monitoring and managing their health over time. We will take your comments into consideration and work on improving the wording in our app description to make it more accurate and clear. Thank you for your input.

Megaleeooo60
Es una aplicaci√≥n de lo peor que hay. Te enga√±an con eso de que sirve para la saturaci√≥n y en realidad hasta el monitor del pulso es deficiente. Me cobraron la suscripci√≥n anual y nunca funcion√≥ correctamente. Ahora tienen el cinismo de pedir que renueve mi suscripci√≥n y no puedo dar de baja esa suscripci√≥n!!! Odiosa aplicaci√≥n!!

Heart rate is fake
MrTangyrine
Put it up to anything red and it‚Äôll give it a pulse. Tried it with a water bottle that had dye in it and it came back with 90~ bpm. Waste of time.

Garbage app. Not only is the heart rate monitor completely inaccurate it is the only thing this app tracks. The rest you have to find from another source and then they have a space for you to write it down if you want but they don‚Äôt test it for you. Save your time, save your money, find another app that‚Äôs free.

Misleading - Can‚Äôt Check Blood Pressure
MistaSavvy
The app can check your BPM, and compared to my oximeter, the BPM reading is accurate. However, it cannot check your blood pressure. It has a journal sort of feature for you to manually enter blood pressure readings, but the App Store app page makes it seem like you can actually check your pressure. I wanted to see if an app can do such a thing and apparently this one can‚Äôt. If the App Store page was less misleading, I wouldn‚Äôt rate it low. 1/5‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs

A bit misleading
Pawsington
$58 a year for a pulse reading that I can take myself for free? The description mentions oxygen level and blood pressure (what I was after) but they are only for record keeping for numbers sourced elsewhere. This is just a heart rate monitor and tracker for other data. I selected the free trial initially but then the $1.11 a week ($58 yearly) option defaults to $11 a week. $58 a year would be reasonable for oxygen level and blood pressure monitoring otherwise pure record keeping can be done through many free apps.

Very disappointed!! Do not download!
Tate, Kit, Kyle
I never leave reviews but this was ridiculous! As soon as I opened the app it said that it cost $39.99 to use but I could get a free trial first. I don‚Äôt mind paying for a health app if I‚Äôm going to use it but I couldn‚Äôt even feel what the app was capable of doing yet. I enabled the free trial so I could see if it was something I‚Äôd use before I paid so much money. I could go to a real doctor for the amount it costs. Even though I enabled the free trial, it immediately charged me $42.89! Then when I got to actually look at and using the app, none of the tests actually work. I tested it against my Apple Watch and my actual cuff and it was just giving me random numbers, not even close to accurate. I am beyond disappointed and furious that I was changed so much for such a fake product. DO NOT RECOMMEND! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

You can be excused if you are led to believe that this app will measure your blood sugar or blood pressure as that is exactly what the sales pitch tries to convince you. It‚Äôs only skill is counting your pulse with a camera as many free apps will do. But go ahead and pay $6.99 a month if you are feeling generous

kitty_cat123456
This app is not designed like normal apps, making it very difficult to remove your subscription. Typically you can go to your settings and do this, but this app doesn‚Äôt allow you to cancel in your subscriptions. This is an assumption, but I‚Äôm thinking this app is a scam. I‚Äôve contacted support for the app to remove my subscription and I didn‚Äôt get any reply.

This app just doesn‚Äôt work, except occasionally between noon and 3 pm.

little_mousie224
I should‚Äôve suspected this already considering it uses a simple camera to calculate heart rate. It never input my heart rate correctly. When my Apple Watch and just based on manual reading my heart rate would be 120-150bpm and this app wouldn‚Äôt read my heart higher than 83bpm. Yes, I did make sure my finger was in the right position. Waste of time and money.

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Kindly note that our app is based on contact photoplethysmography. You may find this information in the FAQ section of the application. The algorithm detects variations of light absorption caused by arterial blood-volume pulsations. However, this method may result in inaccurate readings if you try to measure the light on non-living objects. Just drop us an email at support@aiby.com if you require any assistance.

This app is just a cash grab I have a heart condition where I have very irregular heartbeat so I have to keep track of it very closely. I thought this would be a nice simple way for me to check my heart rate when I‚Äôm not at my house so I checked my own heart rate when I got home because it was over 100 which is not normal for me to have without me feeling anything so I checked my heart rate it was like oh perfectly regular heart rate and I checked it again on the app and it said it was over 100 and I want to check it one more time to make sure that that was what it wanted to say and it would not allow me to check my heart rate again I had to pay for the membership I‚Äôm not going to do that that‚Äôs dumb

Does not measure BO2 or Blood Pressure
mark.allous
It was not entirely clear from the description whether this actually measures the above. The description says ‚Äújournal‚Ä¶‚Äù but it would be helpful to clarify that it does not measure BO2/blood pressure (only heart rate). I did not test the heart rate function as I was only interested in blood pressure. It was also not clear whether there was a free version. Upon downloading the app and enabling/disabling notification & data, you‚Äôre greeting with subscription pricing and whether you want the 3 day trial. Some reviews mention a free version, if this is the free version and there was a way around the pay wall, it was not as clear as it should‚Äôve been. Regardless, you can just use the three day trial and cancel easily via Apple‚Äôs Settings.

Lybra1976
Cercavo un app con misurazione pressione sanguigna, avevo capito che questo lo facesse invece misura solo la frequenza cardiaca, cosa che qualsiasi orologio fa senza necessit√† di abbonamento. Altra cosa incresciosa, avevo selezionato periodo di prova e non so com‚Äô√® √® partito subito l‚Äôabbonamento. Apple in genere √® bello ma la gestione degli abbonamenti √® da rivedere totalmente.

Just to try it out you have to commit to a free trial for $4.99 a month. You cannot even try it free. The documentation on the application page claims that the heart rate is accurate, but blood pressure and oxygen levels are approximate. The only thing that this does is free with your iPhone, and that is heart rate.

I have no idea how this gets the rating it gets, as for me it simple gives very inaccurate readings, I have iPhone 12 Pro Max , upto date software, and the monitor is dangerously miles out . I measured my resting heart rate several times at 67-69 bpm when it was actually around 53-56. If you were to use this during excerise you could be at severe risk !!! Avoid avoid avoid .

It was good at first even the free version with the basic features but I was surprised to come back to the app and have it tell me that my bag had a pulse of 95 bpm so I‚Äôm guessing this isn‚Äôt really accurate.

I was trying out the free version as I saw this app being advertised on TikTok and I put my finger on the camera as it told me to and it worked perfectly but when I put the left my phone I came back to it saying my couch had a heart rate of 73 bpm

I checked my pulse with the app and it said 73 bmp so I decided to check my pulse myself because my pulse is higher than that normally. I checked my pulse myself twice and both times my pulse was 81 bpm, do not rely on this app to tell you your correct pulse as it is off by a fair bit.

I download and paid the premium subscription $69.99 for a year in September because I want the Oxigen and BP measurements as well, works for a few day and now just Pulse, which I can do easily with my I-watch! I am not receiving what I supposed to receive. I emailed twice and nobody answers. Don't invest your money in such a irresponsible company.

Everything on the app from the moment you open it to when you close it will try and make you upgrade to the premium. Every feature requires the premium. The BPM function is totally fake! It said my bed has a BPM of 76. Don‚Äôt wast your time or money on this app.

It does not work, it does not measure oxygen saturation or blood pressure through Face ID as it did. And an app that promises you all this and the only thing you do and measure the pulse with your finger on the camera. I don't advise anyone to buy if you won't feel misled like me. The support is terrible

False readings
P Maker
Ended up in hospital via ambulance after this app gave false heart rate readings that showed I was normal when in fact I was in life threatening AF. Also, you have to pay a non-refundable ¬£48 to even try this app. So for ¬£48, I got a useless app, emergency ride in an ambulance, stay in hospital with cardioversion treatment.

Kcamp321
Downloaded this app several months ago with the free trial. Did not choose premium subscription. Suddenly I realize I‚Äôve been charged $7 per week for the last several months for the premium subscription on an app that does not work. Shame on me for not checking these charges more closely, shame on the developers for creating a scam, and shame on you if you download it after all these poor reviews.

giiiaaaaaa-
Starting off, whenever I open this app it says its not connecting, I hit button and it lets me in. Keep in mind I‚Äôm on wifi 24/7 and when I‚Äôm not it automatically uses my cellular. Next, when checking my heart rate it always go up. You might be saying, ‚ÄúWell yea, our heart rates fluctuate as human beings,‚Äù no. It goes up because I guess I have like anxiety or something because the heart beat noise and vibration it plays makes me nervous and the rate goes up. Btw I did not pay for a subscription.

Why would I need to pay to see my heart rate, oxygen level and nutrition, basically my health? I just want to see how healthy I am If I need to be more healthier in food, there are many free apps that helps with that, but these kind of apps always want money. Checking my heart rate through a phone lens camera and want me to pay to view ‚Äúmore details‚Äù only a foolish person will fall for this.

Tested out and the heart rate is not very accurate. Also app is not free as per advertised, and has an expensive subscription, unless you only want 3 measurements a day. Also BP and blood oxygen don‚Äôt work. Steer clear, not worth the time.
